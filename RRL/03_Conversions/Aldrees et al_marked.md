Abstract
Credit risk assessment uses finance-based behavioural patterns for micro-lending purposes and organizations.
The repayment behaviour and credit stability patterns are analyzed across varying repayment tenures and financed
amounts. Due to limited borrower data and fluctuating financial patterns, micro-lending platforms have substan-
tial hurdles when it comes to effectively evaluating credit risk. This article introduces a Collaborative Filtering
Method using Lending Pattern Analysis (CFM-LPA). The proposed method is enhanced through collaborative
federated learning, enabling the analysis of these patterns. This approach evaluates the return rate, credit limit,
and consumer response behaviours. Federated learning processes one or more of these factors to assess diverse
lending patterns. Based on these evaluations, the behavioural factor is updated for each return period, influencing
the credit risk for subsequent return periods and supporting the financial stability of micro-lending operations.
The model is trained individually on the identified factors, allowing the behavioural factor to be filtered. New
credit risks are identified using this filtered factor from the previous return period. These insights help define
new behavioural patterns for the specified credit limit. The proposed method enhances risk detection accuracy
by 14.03% and improves return rate analysis by 13.28% across financed amounts. The above abstract is also
graphically presented.

1 Introduction
Credit risk assessment is a must in every micro-lending organization. The actual credit risks are assessed using
finance-based behavioural patterns in micro-lending organizations. The behavioural patterns provide stability,
interest rate, and return capacity [1]. A unique credit risk assessment strategy is used in micro-lending organiza-
tions. The assessment strategy uses logistics functions to determine the financial risks that may occur after lend-
ing small funds or loans [2, 3]. The exact severity level of the risks is calculated to produce feasible information
for assessment services. The strategy predicts the successful finding of factors minimizing financial crises or
risk rates in money lending services [4]. A credit risk analysis technique is also used to analyze the risk ratio for
micro-lending services. The analysis technique evaluates the potential risk factors that cause credit risks to the
services [5]. The technique identifies the interest rate and predicts the credit risks based on financial stabilities.
The analysis technique provides the possibility of risks, which reduces the computational complexity of lending.
The technique improves the performance and efficiency of assessment services [6].
Behavioural patterns are analyzed and evaluated, which produces an effective dataset for credit risk predic-
tion in lending applications. The patterns provide details such as financial status, credit details, interest rates,
and the impact of micro-lending on customers [7]. A behavioural pattern analysis approach predicts credit risks
in micro-lending services. The analysis approach evaluates the impact of loan borrowers’ financial status and
consistency while paying the debts [8]. The approach identifies the difference between the behavioural patterns
and produces feasible data for detection processes. The analysis approach elevates the accuracy rate of credit risk
detection and enhances the efficiency range of the lending systems. A tracing detection method is used in lending
systems for credit risk prediction [9, 10]. The detection method uses software to analyze the behavioural pattern
of the borrower and lender’s activity on online platforms. The method provides empirical features to calculate
the credit risks as per severity. The method also reduces the computational cost during detection, enhancing the
systems’ performance. The detection method minimizes the latency range and provides optimal user lending
services [11, 12].
Machine learning (ML) methods are used in micro-lending systems for credit risk analysis services. ML meth-
ods improve the detection services’ precision and accuracy [13]. A credit risk assessment using an ML algorithm
is used in micro- and macro-lending applications. The assessment model addresses the common issues that cause
application credit risks [14]. The model uses a linear learning analysis method to analyze the overheads and factors
of the systems. The assessment model also investigates the actual cause of risks using ML, which minimizes the
energy consumption range of the systems [15, 16]. The assessment model maximizes the credit risk prediction
and reduces the financial risk factors while lending money to borrowers [17]. A random forest algorithm-based
credit risk analysis technique is also used in lending applications. The random forest algorithm analyses the
dynamic and systemic credit features to evaluate the actual stages of risks [18]. The analysis technique provides
a feasible solution to solve the issues from the applications. It also provides companion strategies to reduce risk
rates from the systems. The algorithm reduces micro-lending services’ fault and credit risk ratio [19]. The role of
consumer behaviour decides the credit risk and further lending in small-scale financial services. This customer/
consumer behaviour is defined by various factors that influence credit return policies. A precise credit level/ risk
level decision will be made based on the fluctuating influencing factors. Motivated by this factor, the proposed
credit risk analysis method is designed and discussed.
1.1 Research Gap
Data shortage, borrower variety, and privacy issues contribute to micro-lending platforms’ ongoing struggles with
proper credit risk assessment. Due to security concerns and a lack of flexibility for changing financial patterns,
traditional credit scoring algorithms often depend on centralized data collecting. Moreover, micro-lending situ-
ations often do not have access to the large amounts of labelled data needed by current machine learning-based

methods, resulting in less-than-ideal risk projections. However, this research is not fit for decentralized financial
ecosystems since they do not adequately include privacy-preserving approaches in behavioural analysis for credit
evaluation. Accurate credit risk assessment must be achieved in micro-lending situations while protecting user
data’s privacy and security.
1.2 Objectives
This research focuses on the Collaborative Filtering Method utilizing Lending Pattern Analysis (CFM-LPA), an
attempt to improve micro-lending credit risk assessment via the integration of federated learning and collabora-
tive filtering. The main goal is to guarantee data privacy via decentralized learning and increase the accuracy
of credit risk prediction by using borrower behaviour patterns. A scalable and adaptable model that can capture
shifting financial habits is also one of the article’s goals, which aims to improve lending practices. More informed
lending choices in micro-lending contexts may be supported by this research’s robust, privacy-preserving, and
data-driven methodology, which addresses the constraints of existing credit scoring methods.
The article makes the following contributions:
1. Introducing and discussing a novel credit risk analysis method supported by federated learning and collabora-
tive learning techniques.
2. Exploring the role of various factors influencing financial stability provides insights into their combined
impact through comprehensive analysis.
3. A data-driven approach can be defined to verify the self-analytical factors of the proposed method.
4. A comparative analysis will be presented to evaluate and validate the efficiency of the proposed method.

LPA model, Sect. 4 deliberates the results and discussion and Sect. 5 concludes the research paper.

Microlending services rely on heterogeneous patterns classified under services and consumer behaviours. The
conventional methods rely on return rate and customer history for further lending and validation. ML-based solu-
tions rely on the statistical computation of return rate to increase the credit level and thereby infer the reduction
rates. However, this is feasible for a large financial service, whereas in a low-interest-rated financial service, the
different patterns (customer return and lending) impact credit risks differently. These include delayed response
or failed returns across increasing scheduled tenures. This article proposes a pattern-converted behaviour factor
assessment method using federated learning to address these diverse issues. This method validates financial and
customer factors to identify filtered risks in lending credits. Traditional machine learning models and ensemble
approaches comprise the bulk of the existing literature on micro-lending credit risk assessment; however, these
methods often depend on centralized data sources, which might lead to privacy problems. A lack of complete

integration of borrower behavioural patterns limits the forecasting accuracy of techniques like GAN-LightGBM
and SMOTE-ENN, which address data imbalance and feature selection. In addition, the difficulties of data frag-
mentation among financial institutions are mostly ignored in most research, resulting in inadequate risk evalu-
ations and incomplete borrower profiles. Research on the combination of federated learning with collaborative
filtering for customized credit risk prediction is still in its early stages, but it provides a privacy-preserving option.
Furthermore, there are significant inequalities in accountability and long-term dependability caused by the fact
that current models seldom ever deal with problems such as model drift, adversarial robustness, and demographic
biases in loan choices. Improving risk detection while guaranteeing data privacy and transparency is the goal of
the proposed CFM-LPA paradigm, which employs federated learning and collaborative filtering to fill these gaps.
3 Data Description
Credit risk analysis data from [36] is used to validate the proposed method using fuzzy optimization. The data
is classified under 12 features utilizing personal and loan-related information. The status and history of the data
provided are used to analyze the behaviour factor. The behaviour factor computation process uses the return rate,
prompt return, and credit limit. Thus, the data used to evaluate the proposed method is described in Fig. 1.
The data are split into three blocks: initial input (return + Response) and behaviour pattern. For this purpose
the above-referenced data with the following feature values is used: the age ranges between (20 and 45), income
(4 K to 2039 K), ownership (rented, own, mortgage, employment tenure (1 to 31 yrs), loan purpose (personal,
education, venture, medical, home needs), loan grade (A to D), loan amount (0.5 K to 35 K), interest rate (5.42
to 23.22), loan status (0-nil, 1-pending) per cent of loan income (0 to 0.83), the credit history (2 to 30 years). The
above data are provided for 32,581 record sets as collected from the dataset. The notable parameters: credit his-
tory, grade, status, and income % decide the behaviour patterns of the consumers. This pattern detection finalizes
the credit risk under different lending periods (Refer to Fig. 1).
4 Proposed Collaborative Filtering Method Using Filtering Pattern for Credit Risk
Analysis
Credit risk assessment is one of the most important aspects of the sustainability and profitability of micro-
lending organizations. In micro-lending, understanding the financial behaviour of borrowers is critical to
minimize defaults and optimize credit distribution. This incorporates a Collaborative Filtering Method (CFM)
to enhance credit risk assessment using Lending Pattern (LP) analysis. The critical factors, including return

rates, credit limits, and consumer response behaviours, were evaluated through collaborative federated learn-
ing. The federated approach allows for the decentralized analysis of lending patterns in a manner that ensures
data privacy and security requirements in any financial system. The CFM analyzes such factors over suc-
cessive repayment periods, identifies behaviour trends, and refines its credit risk assessment. This approach
offers strong credit stability prediction and limit optimization to ensure the financial stability of micro-lending

predict the risk in the environment at a time.

To predict the risk in micro-lending, it is important to monitor and analyze factors that lead to environmental
C
risk. The credit limit is denoted as  lm which is provided to the borrower with a particular limit. It helps to meas-
ure how the credit is extended to the borrower over time. A high credit limit may indicate a financial risk and
affect the behavioural pattern. The borrower’s credit score is represented as Br C and  B fact measures the behaviour

risk which monitors the risk factors during the credit period. The term  fact  measures the
behaviour factor for the next time to predict the upcoming environmental credit risk. This helps monitor the
micro-lending organization to adapt to changing financial conditions and mitigate financial risk. The return rate

features and, by extension, their credit risk. Utilizing a combination of user- and item-based filtering algorithms, it
generates risk ratings by analyzing lending behaviour, repayment history, and financial transactions. This is made
easier using the federated learning architecture, allowing decentralized model training across several banks without
exposing sensitive information. This improves generalizability across varied datasets while also preserving privacy.
With the use of tools like Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the federated model may improve risk assessment models
and reduce data silo problems by aggregating local changes. Further optimization is necessary to address non-IID
data distributions, communication costs, and model drift. This will guarantee scalable and resilient performance in
real-world financial applications. Based on this factor, the analysis of Br
risk is presented in Fig. 3.
Credit risk assessment incorporates risk factors such as default rate, repayment, and credit history. It is moni-

lending process. This helps to predict the borrower’s loan repayment and performance to be adjusted for the
borrower’s specific behaviour. The behaviour pattern detection process is presented in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 Behavior Pattern Detection
A CFM using an LP helps to analyze the credit risk, which is discussed in the following sections.
4.1 Collaborative Filtering
The historical data of multiple borrowers were evaluated using the CFM and LP to analyze patterns of repayment
behaviour and predict future loan performance. It monitors repayment history, credit limits, return rates, and
borrower behaviour in different segments to analyze the similarities between borrowers. The identified patterns
were used to classify and predict new borrowers’ credit and repayment defaults. LP analysis mainly identifies the
consistent traits of borrowing behaviour, such as timely repayments, the proportion of loans repaid, and financial
stability indicators. CFM enhances lending decisions through federated learning without exchanging borrower-
specific data directly to maintain privacy. The system filters relevant behaviour factors to predict the borrower’s
future repayment behaviour and determine the associated credit risk. The borrower’s profile was updated every
repayment period to change behaviours for accurate credit risk assessments and better lending decisions in suc-
cessive cycles. The following equation Len pat measures the process of LPs for credit risk.

during lending between borrowers. The term  risk  measures the credit risk for time   to monitor the
next risk period during lending. This combines the adjusted and actual LP with credit history to ensure accurate
prediction. Federated learning continuously updates this LP to ensure that the new borrower is assessed based on
the current LPs and economic conditions. LP analysis is presented in Fig. 4.
The variations in risk factors may lead to high risk in the micro-lending platform. These variations were moni-
tored and analyzed using pattern analysis. The proposed method, which ensures consistent repayment, ensures
high pattern analysis. This high value indicates strong patterns that align with borrowers’ financial stability and
consistent behaviour. Incorporating federated learning aggregates data across varying lending scenarios with pri-
vacy to analyze the patterns. A borrower with a stable pattern of repayments for every month indicates a smooth

lending process without risk. A borrower with irregular repayment and behaviour patterns leads to abnormal
patterns and indicates a potential risk during lending. This high pattern analysis enhances the understanding of
borrower behaviour over time (Fig. 4). The filtering process is described in Algorithm 2.

4.2 Role of Federated Learning
Federated learning is incorporated to learn the pattern variations for multiple lenders and borrowers. In the LP
credit risk assessment, federated learning ensures the data privacy of various micro-lending entities. Federated
learning evaluates the risk that drives return rates, credit limits, and repayment behaviour among diverse micro-
lenders. The system excludes sensitive information related to the borrowers to conform to the LP on data pri-
vacy. It generalized patterns in lending to avoid the risk based on high-risk detection. The historical credit rate is
constantly updated to capture temporal shifts in borrower behaviour and financial risk. A decentralized method

the credit risk according to the initial behavioural factor. Financial adaptability captures income fluctuations and
spending behaviours; loan purpose categorizes lending patterns (e.g., business vs. personal use) to identify risk
profiles; repayment consistency tracks timely and late payments to assess reliability; loan frequency indicates a
borrower’s dependency on micro-loans; peer influence analyzes how similar borrowers impact creditworthiness;
and financial adaptability tracks repayment consistency. By including these parameters in collaborative filtering,
the system can estimate credit risk based on previous patterns by mapping borrowers with similar lending hab-
its. Federated learning allows pattern detection among several lenders without sacrificing privacy by allowing
decentralized institutions to communicate updated models instead of raw data safely. This Ft (t)∀U

financial health and adaptability, contributing to positive lending decisions (Fig. 6). The federated learning pro-

and filtered effectively by the proposed method. It ensures the effectiveness of the CFM in separating risk-
prone borrowers from low-risk. For example, a borrower with a high filtering ratio and poor repayment
behaviour will have high leverage in lending. Meanwhile, a borrower with consistent repayments and a low
filtering ratio will have low leverage in lending. This proposed method continuously refines its analysis
through federated learning to prioritize actionable risks from the obtained risk factors. A high filtering ratio
enhances precision in isolating risky behaviours and ensures a robust assessment (Fig. 7). The risk detection
process is explained in Algorithm 4.
Algorithm 4 Risk Detection Process
The potential for bias in credit scoring algorithms may be reduced using several methods. Methods for
pre-processing data, such as re-sampling (for instance, reweighting underrepresented groups) and SMOTE
(for example, synthetic data production), may help achieve class distribution parity. Model training may be
adjusted to eliminate inequalities using in-processing approaches such as adversarial debiasing or fairness-
aware loss functions. Adjustments to thresholds and re-ranking procedures are examples of post-processing
solutions that guarantee fairness in final decision-making without changing the underlying model. Decentral-
ized fairness-aware optimization approaches and individualized model changes are necessary to minimize
systemic biases, particularly in federated learning contexts.

5 Results and Discussion
The results for two new risk and return rate metrics are discussed in this part. The results are analyzed using the
WEKA tool by analyzing the raw input data formatted for credit risk analysis. In this results part, the existing
SMOTE-ENN (referenced in [21]), Light GBM-GAN (referenced in [20]), and FEEM-VO (Referenced in [22])
methods are considered for comparative analysis. The X-variants are: tenure (2 to 20 yrs.), interest rate (5 to
23), amt(K) (5 to 35), and C lm (A to D) considered. The comparative analysis results are graphically presented in
Figs. 8 and 9 for the above metrics.
To enhance the reliability of the findings, this research incorporates 95% confidence intervals (for
instance, ± 2.1% for accuracy) and statistical significance tests such as a paired t-test (p < 0.05) and Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. For reliability, information on hyperparameter adjustment is additionally required. Applying
Bayesian Optimization across a fivefold cross-validation setup, the following parameters were optimized for
the XGBoost model used for credit risk assessment: number of boosting rounds = 500, learning_rate = 0.05,
max_depth = 6, subsample = 0.8, fraction of features used per tree = 0.7, and L2 regularization lambda = 1.2.
One possible source of bias in the dataset is the difference between Group A (the majority) and Group B (the
minority). Group A has an average credit score of 720, an acceptance rate of 85% for loans, and a default rate
of 5%. In contrast, Group B has a lower approval rate of 65%, an average score of 680, and a slightly higher
default rate of 7%. One way to address these biases is by using fairness-aware techniques. These techniques

include reweighting training data to ensure underrepresented groups are balanced, using equalized odds con-
straints to ensure risk-equivalent applicants have consistent approval rates, and using explainability methods
like SHAP or LIME to find biased feature contributions and adjust them. Table 2 shows the experimental setup.
The occurrence of newly identified risks with time-based on borrower specification is analyzed using the
proposed method. The proposed method ensures fewer values, which indicates a minimal emergence of new
risks. Federated learning continuously updates the models based on previously unseen risks identified based
on credit history. The accurate filtering and pattern analysis reduce the emergence of new risks and ensure
the stability of the credit assessment in micro-lending. If a borrower with variation in financial behaviour
stabilizes their repayment patterns, there will be a high possibility of new risk. A borrower with predictable
and stable financial behaviour will have a low occurrence of new risk (Fig. 8).
The return rate in micro-lending represents the proportion of borrowers repaying loans on time. The proposed
CFM with LP analysis improves the return rate compared to existing methods. The existing methods often fail
to adapt borrower behaviours based on economic conditions. It leads to lower and unstable return rates dur-
ing economic downturns. The proposed method continuously updates borrower credit patterns using federated
learning to monitor repayment behaviours during unstable economic conditions and R rate > C lm ∀ amt−E con
indicates the possibility of risk. This helps to identify where the return rate declines during market fluctuations
( )
and environmental factors. It maintains stability to enhance risk filtering and improves repayment outcomes in a
micro-lending environment (Fig. 9). Table 3 shows the comparative analysis.
As data distributions vary over time, a phenomenon known as model drift occurs, and the prediction perfor-
mance continues to decline. The problem is much more severe in federated networks when clients’ data is distrib-

necessary to combat drift. Concept drift detection approaches, such as adaptive windowing (ADWIN) or Kol-
mogorov–Smirnov tests, may be used to monitor model performance continuously. This allows for timely model
upgrades to be triggered to retain accuracy. One adversarial attack is model poisoning, in which malicious clients
insert biased gradients into a federated learning system. Another type is inference attacks, in which attackers try to
retrieve private data from shared model updates. Defending against poisoning attacks may be done via defensive
measures like Byzantine-resilient aggregation (like Krum or median-based filtering). To avoid inference attacks
without compromising model usefulness, utilize differential privacy strategies like secure multi-party comput-
ing (MPC) or local perturbation (e.g., Gaussian noise addition). Further improvements to federated learning
framework security and trust may be achieved via robust encryption methods and consensus mechanisms based
on blockchain technology.
6   Conclusion
The proposed CFM with LP analysis is transformative in credit risk assessment for micro-lending. The method
integrates federated learning and behavioural analysis to understand borrowers’ repayment trends and credit
stability. The continuous evaluation of return rates with credit limits and consumer responses predicts the risk
assessment with the financial behaviours of the borrowers. This approach improves the accuracy of credit risk
models that protect data. The filtering and utilization of behavioural factors from previous return periods allow
micro-lending organizations to adjust their approach according to the dynamics of the borrowers. It helps to
avoid risks and enhance sustained growth in the micro-lending platform. The proposed method reduces default
rates and ensures stronger financial systems with high-risk detection in the micro-lending. The proposed method
improves the risk detection analysis by 14.82% and return rate analysis by 13.63% for the different interest rates.
H However, the model’s reliance on collaborative filtering may introduce biases if the available lending data is

sparse or imbalanced, potentially leading to inaccurate risk predictions for new or underrepresented borrowers.
Federated learning ensures data privacy; it requires significant computational resources and robust synchroniza-
tion across multiple lending institutions, which may pose scalability challenges. Future studies will improve the
model’s scalability through efficient communication protocols in federated learning, help reduce computational
overhead and incorporate real-time financial indicators and alternative credit data sources, such as social and
transactional behaviour, to improve adaptability to dynamic lending environments.

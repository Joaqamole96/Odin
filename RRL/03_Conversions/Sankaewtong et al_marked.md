that removing a small percentage of extreme points
before clustering significantly improves overall fraud
detection rates. Similarly, [109] and [110] combine
k-means,Mahalanobisdistance,andunsupervisedSup-
port Vector Machines (SVMs) to detect anomalies in
both user-centric and transaction-centric graphs. For a
user-centric graph, each node represents an individual
user, aggregating one or more Bitcoin addresses, and
edges between nodes capture transactions between
users.Incontrast,atransaction-centricgraphtreatseach

the Bitcoin flow. By extracting features such as in-
degree, out-degree, average transaction size, and time-
interval statistics, their pipelines reveal that suspicious

• Collective & Address Aggregation Approaches:
Other works focus on either addressing large-scale or
complex transaction graphs. Reference [112] studies
malicious address identification in Bitcoin by combin-
ing temporal burst features, e.g., abrupt increases in
transactionvolumeordegree,andgraph-basedmetrics,
e.g., clustering coefficient, in/out-degree. The study
highlights that aggregating addresses controlled by
the same user is crucial for achieving more accurate
anomaly scoring, i.e., disregarding the concept of
‘‘change addresses’’ can dilute signals indicative of
malicious behavior. In a typical Bitcoin transaction,
a user must spend the entire input, even if they intend
to send only a part of that amount to another party.
Theremainingbalanceisthensentbacktothesender’s
wallet via a new, often unrelated-looking address
called a change address. Reference [113] extends such
ideas using a collective anomaly detection paradigm
in Bitcoin, whereby clusters of wallets owned by
the same user are analyzed as a whole rather than
individually.Experimentalresultsshowthatconsidering

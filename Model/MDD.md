**Document Version:** v1.0  
**Module Name:** Financial Behavioral Profile Classifier  
**Author(s):** Guevarra 
**Date:** 2026-07-16  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 0. Module Context & Isolation Boundary (The Invariant Contract)
*This section is non-negotiable and pre-defines the module's API boundaries. The rest of the document serves to realize this contract.*

### 0.1. Module Function
*Classifies a user's Financial Behavioral Profile (FBP) into one of four categories (Stable-Flexible, Stable-Obligated, Variable-Flexible, Variable-Obligated), by selecting and running the best-performing classification algorithm against whatever transaction history currently exists for that user, including partial, short-window, or self-logged data of inconsistent quality.*

### 0.2. Strict Input Contract (What the module receives)
- **Structure:** JSON
- **Required Fields:** 

| Field | Type | Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `user_id` | String | Non-null, valid UUID format |
| `classification_mode` | String | Must be one of: `STANDARD`, `QUESTIONNAIRE` |
| `payload.historical_transactions` | List[Object] | Required if mode is `STANDARD`; array of transaction objects |
| `payload.questionnaire_answers` | Dict | Required if mode is `QUESTIONNAIRE`; key-value pairs of question IDs and answers |

- **Rejection Criteria:** 
  - Empty `user_id`
  - Invalid `classification_mode` value
  - Missing required payload fields for the specified mode
  - Empty transaction list for `STANDARD` mode
  - Incomplete questionnaire answers for `QUESTIONNAIRE` mode

### 0.3. Strict Output Contract (What the module returns)
- **Structure:** JSON
- **Required Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `prediction` | String | One of: `STABLE_FLEXIBLE`, `STABLE_OBLIGATED`, `VARIABLE_FLEXIBLE`, `VARIABLE_OBLIGATED` |
| `income_stability_score` | Float | Calibrated score between 0 and 1 |
| `obligation_weight_score` | Float | Calibrated score between 0 and 1 |
| `confidence` | Float | Calibrated confidence score between 0 and 1 |
| `status` | String | `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `FALLBACK` |

- **Guaranteed Behavior:** The module must never throw an unhandled exception. It must always return the structured contract (using fallback values if the model fails).

### 0.4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Out of Scope)
- **This module does NOT** manage user authentication or session state.
- **This module does NOT** persist classification results to any external database.
- **This module does NOT** handle user consent or privacy policy enforcement.
- **This module does NOT** interact with external microservices during inference.

---

## 1. Problem Statement (Scope, Objectives, and KPIs)
*Define the predictive problem in purely statistical/mathematical terms. Be agnostic about *how* to solve it.*

- **Core Problem:** Multi-class classification with 4 balanced classes (Stable-Flexible, Stable-Obligated, Variable-Flexible, Variable-Obligated), derived from two binary dimensions (income stability and obligation weight). The research question this module answers is: given partial-window, noisy, or inconsistently self-logged transaction data, which classification algorithm — trained to approximate that same label from indirect and partial signals — most reliably reproduces the ground-truth class a full, clean 3-month history would eventually yield?

- **Stakeholders:** The FBP Module consumes the output for profile assignment and drift detection.

---

## 2. Data Collection Plan (Sourcing, Types, and Sizes)
*Define what data is required to train this module, without committing to the final dataset.*

- **Sourcing Strategy:** 
  - **Primary:** Synthetic personas generated from PSA 2023 FIES microdata (income/expense totals, family size and weight, population weight, urban/rural, per-capita income, decile ranking), disaggregated to the individual level and augmented with granular, time-stamped transaction data via a shared persona-generation methodology
  - **Secondary:** Historical anonymized transaction data from thesis prototype users, once available, used to validate synthetic-to-real generalization
  - **Tertiary:** Questionnaire response data from onboarding, used as a secondary/validation label source, not the primary ground truth

- **Required Data Types:** 
  - Time-series transaction data (amount, category, date, type)
  - Income frequency and amount data
  - Expense category distributions
  - Indirect/behavioral features injected during persona augmentation (spending timing relative to payday, category diversity, amount volatility, inter-transaction gaps)
  - Binary labels for income stability and obligation weight

- **Why indirect features must be synthetically injected rather than sourced from FIES:** FIES microdata is anonymized per RA 10173 (Data Privacy Act) and PSA disclosure policy, and contains only the aggregate/geographic fields listed above — it was never designed to capture person-level behavioral signals like spending timing or transaction-level volatility. There is no available Filipino dataset that pairs household financial totals with granular behavioral transaction data. Persona-based synthesis is therefore the only feasible route to a labeled dataset with both a defensible ground-truth class and the indirect features the learned candidates are meant to exploit.

- **Minimum Viable Dataset Size:** 
  - At least 1,000 labeled personas per class (4,000 total), each with a full 3-month "mature" transaction history for ground-truth label derivation
  - Each mature persona additionally sampled at multiple partial-window cuts (e.g., first 2 weeks, first 4 weeks, first 6 weeks) to train and evaluate candidates under the realistic partial-data condition described in Section 1
  - Explicit persona-generation targets set per FBP quadrant to avoid underrepresenting classes likely to be rarer in the general population (e.g., Variable-Obligated)

- **Labeling Strategy:** 
  - **Primary (ground truth):** Deterministic label = score/threshold formula applied to each persona's full, mature 3-month window. This is computed automatically, not manually annotated, since income stability and obligation weight are themselves defined as computable scores with fixed thresholds.
  - **Secondary (validation only):** Questionnaire-style answers generated per persona, checked for agreement with the deterministic label
  - **Manual expert review:** Reserved only for personas whose computed score sits within a defined margin of the classification threshold (i.e., ambiguous/borderline cases) — a small, tractable review load for a single financial expert, rather than annotating all 4,000 samples from scratch

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Specifications
*Identify potential data quality issues and the criteria for handling them. Explicitly keep the methods open-ended.*

- **Potential Issues:** 
  - Missing transaction data (gaps in history)
  - Duplicate entries from bulk imports
  - Inconsistent category naming
  - Outlier amounts (extremely high/low values)
  - Class imbalance in income stability labels

- **Handling Criteria (Agnostic):** 
  - *Decision Gate:* We will evaluate the impact of deleting incomplete records vs. imputation
  - *Candidate Techniques to Explore:* 
    - Null imputation: Mean/median imputation for continuous variables, mode for categorical
    - Duplicate deduplication: Exact matching + fuzzy matching for transaction descriptions
    - Outlier capping: IQR method (1.5× IQR threshold) or Z-score (>3σ)
    - Class balancing: SMOTE or class-weighted training

- **Data Versioning:** Raw and cleaned datasets will be stored in versioned S3 buckets or a local data registry with SHA hashes for reproducibility.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Plan
*State the hypotheses to test and the visualizations/investigations required before modeling.*

- **Hypotheses to Validate:** 
  - Income stability is strongly correlated with employment type
  - Obligation weight is correlated with age and household size
  - The four FBP classes are separable in the transaction-feature space
  - Stable-Obligated users show consistent patterns in essential spending

- **Required Statistical Summaries:** 
  - Distribution of target variables (class counts)
  - Feature means/variances across classes
  - Skewness of transaction amounts by category
  - Monthly income variance by employment type

- **Correlation Targets:** 
  - Income stability vs. income standard deviation, employment type, income frequency
  - Obligation weight vs. essential spending ratio, household size, age
  - Class membership vs. spending category distributions

- **Outcome of this phase:** The EDA will determine if we need feature scaling, log-transformations, or more aggressive cleaning.

---

## 5. Feature Engineering Strategy
*Define the target feature space dimensions and the strategies to compare.*

- **Feature Encoding Candidates:** 
  - One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (employment type, category groups)
  - Label Encoding for ordinal categories (education level, age ranges)
  - Cyclical encoding for temporal features (month, day of week)

- **Derived Features:**
  - Income stability: Standard deviation of monthly income, coefficient of variation, frequency consistency score
  - Obligation weight: Ratio of essential+obligatory expenses to total expenses
  - Spending diversity: Number of distinct categories used
  - Temporal patterns: Weekend vs. weekday spending ratio, seasonal patterns

- **Scaling Candidates:** 
  - Min-Max scaling (feature range = [0,1])
  - Standardization (Z-score normalization)
  - Robust scaling (using median and IQR, less sensitive to outliers)

- **Dimensionality Reduction Candidates:** 
  - PCA (to reduce to 10-20 components if overfitting occurs)
  - Feature importance selection from Random Forest (top N features)
  - t-SNE for visualization only (not for production)

- **Constraint:** Feature engineering pipeline must fit within memory/compute constraints defined in Section 1.

---

## 6. Data Modeling Strategy (Algorithm Selection & Baseline)
*Define the tiered approach to modeling. **Crucially**, do not select the final model here; define the selection criteria.*

- **Tier 0: Naive Baseline (Sanity Floor):** 
  - Majority-class predictor (always predicts the most frequent FBP class in the training persona set)
  - Purpose: The absolute floor any candidate — rule-based or learned — must clear to be considered informative at all

- **Tier 1: Deterministic Rule-Based Classifier:** 
  - Direct application of the income-stability and obligation-weight score/threshold definitions to whatever transaction window is available (full or partial), producing the quadrant label
  - Threshold values are calibrated on the training persona set (e.g., via ROC-based cutoff selection) rather than fixed a priori, so the comparison against learned candidates is fair

- **Tier 2: Intermediate Learned Model:** 
  - Logistic Regression (multi-class) with L2 regularization
  - Purpose: Simplest learned candidate; establishes whether any learning signal exists beyond the deterministic rule at all

- **Tier 3: Ensemble/Margin-Based Models:** 
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel)
  - Purpose: Test whether ensemble/non-linear methods can exploit the injected indirect/behavioral features better than a threshold rule or linear model

- **Tier 4: Advanced Model:** 
  - XGBoost Classifier (gradient boosting, handles class imbalance well)
  - Multi-layer Perceptron (if deep learning proves necessary)
  - Justified only if Tiers 1–3 fail to meet the KPI

- **Selection Criteria:** Final algorithm chosen based on Performance-to-Latency trade-off across **all** tiers (0–4), not just the learned ones:
  - Highest Macro-F1 score within latency budget, evaluated on the same held-out personas and the same partial-window cuts for every candidate
  - Must maintain >75% per-class accuracy
  - Model size must be deployable in mobile-app context
  - Ties or near-ties (within a pre-registered margin, e.g., 2 points of Macro-F1) are broken in favor of the simpler/more interpretable candidate — i.e., Tier 1 over Tier 3/4 — given the sensitivity of financial classification and the value of an explainable decision to the user

---

## 7. Model Evaluation Plan
*Define the rigorous methodology to compare models fairly, without predefining the outcomes.*

- **Primary Evaluation Metric:** 
  - Macro-F1 Score (primary, prioritizes performance across all four classes equally)
  - Accuracy (secondary, for overall performance)
  - Justification: Macro-F1 handles class imbalance better and treats each FBP equally important

- **Secondary Metrics:** 
  - Per-class precision, recall, F1
  - Inference time (P95 latency)
  - Model size (MB)
  - Failure rate on edge cases (e.g., users with very few transactions)

- **Validation Strategy:** 
  - **Persona-level split** (not transaction-level): entire personas are held out for validation/test, so no candidate is evaluated on a persona whose data it was trained on
  - Stratified K-Fold (k=5) at the persona level to maintain class proportions across folds
  - **Every candidate — Tier 0 through Tier 4 — is evaluated on the identical held-out set and identical partial-window cuts** (full history, first 2 weeks, first 4 weeks, first 6 weeks), so the comparison isolates algorithm choice rather than data access
  - Time-series split (3 months train, 1 month validation) to additionally test temporal generalization on mature-history personas

- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** 
  - Specifically analyze false-positive rates (misclassifying as Stable vs. Variable)
  - Analyze misclassifications between Stable-Flexible and Stable-Obligated (same income dimension, different obligation weight)

- **Pre-registered outcome framing:** This evaluation is a hypothesis test, not a search for a foregone conclusion. Either result is a valid, reportable contribution: (a) a learned tier beats Tier 1 by a pre-registered margin under partial/noisy data, supporting the case for a learned classifier; or (b) no learned tier clears that margin, in which case Tier 1 (the deterministic rule) is selected as the module's final design, and the finding — that a well-calibrated deterministic rule is sufficient for this problem — is documented as the module's actual result rather than treated as an incomplete experiment.

---

## 8. Optimization Strategy (Tuning & Ensembling)
*Define the hyperparameter landscape and optimization budget.*

- **Tier 1 (Rule-Based) Calibration:** 
  - Income-stability and obligation-weight thresholds are not fixed a priori; calibrate cut points on the training persona set (e.g., ROC-based threshold selection maximizing Macro-F1) so Tier 1 gets the same "fitting" opportunity as the learned tiers, keeping the comparison fair

- **Tuning Candidates (Tiers 2–4):** 
  - Grid Search (exhaustive, but limited to small search spaces)
  - Random Search (preferred for larger hyperparameter spaces)

- **Hyperparameter Space for Random Forest:**
  - `n_estimators`: [100, 200, 300, 500]
  - `max_depth`: [10, 20, 30, None]
  - `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10]
  - `class_weight`: ['balanced', 'balanced_subsample']
  - `max_features`: ['sqrt', 'log2']

- **Hyperparameter Space for XGBoost:**
  - `max_depth`: [3, 5, 7]
  - `learning_rate`: [0.01, 0.1, 0.3]
  - `n_estimators`: [100, 200, 300]
  - `subsample`: [0.8, 1.0]
  - `scale_pos_weight`: [1, 2, 5] (for handling imbalance)

- **Ensemble Candidates:** 
  - Stacking: Logistic Regression meta-model on top of Random Forest + XGBoost predictions
  - Voting: Soft voting (averaging probabilities) between Random Forest and XGBoost
  - Only tested if single model plateaus below KPI

---

## 9. Deployment Strategy & Module Packaging
*Define how the finished model will be delivered as a module, without choosing the specific cloud provider.*

- **Interface Requirement:** 
  - Python function: `predict(input: Dict) -> Dict`
  - Must strictly adhere to Section 0 contract
  - Async support for concurrent requests

- **Artifact Delivery:** 
  - Trained model weights and preprocessing pipeline serialized as `.pkl` (Pickle) or `.joblib`
  - Feature transformation pipeline (Scaler, Encoder) also serialized
  - Model version metadata (training data hash, performance metrics)

- **Integration Point:** 
  - Containerized API service (Flask/FastAPI) deployed on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine)
  - Called by mobile app via REST API
  - Dependency injection for model loading at startup

- **Deployment Candidates:** 
  - Docker container (preferred for reproducibility)
  - Serverless function (if latency requirements can be met)
  - Decision based on required latency (Section 1): Docker on dedicated instance for consistent <500ms

---

## 10. Model Monitoring & Lifecycle Plan
*Define how we will know the module is degrading over time, without specifying the monitoring tool.*

- **Metrics to Track Post-Deployment:** 
  - *Input Drift:* Monitor distribution changes in transaction features (income std. dev., obligation weight ratio)
  - *Output Drift:* Monitor changes in prediction confidence and class distribution
  - *Performance:* Weekly accuracy on known labeled samples (if available)

- **Retraining Triggers:** 
  - Weekly average confidence drops below 0.70 for 3 consecutive days
  - Per-class accuracy (on validation set) drops below 0.70
  - Significant input drift detected (PSI > 0.1)

- **Feedback Loop:** 
  - Users can manually correct their FBP via the FBP Screen
  - These corrections serve as ground truth labels for model improvement
  - Quarterly model retraining with accumulated labeled data

---

## 11. Timeline, Dependencies, and Decision Gates
*Break down the 10 phases into a realistic schedule for the thesis project.*

| Phase | Deliverable | Estimated Duration | Success Gate (Go/No-Go) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 & 3 (Data) | Cleaned, versioned dataset | 16 days | Persona set passes expert + distributional validation; minimum 4,000 labeled personas across partial-window cuts |
| 4 & 5 (EDA & Features) | Feature matrix ready; EDA report | 10 days | EDA confirms class separability on both full and partial windows; feature importance identified |
| 6 & 7 (Modeling & Eval) | Tier 0-4 comparative results | 14 days | Tier 0 (majority) beaten by all other tiers; Tier 1 (rule) and Tier 3 (Random Forest) both evaluated on identical held-out personas |
| 8 (Optimization) | Final selected candidate (rule-based or learned) | 7 days | Selected candidate meets KPI: Macro-F1 > 0.80; selection documented against the pre-registered margin from Section 7 |
| 9 & 10 (Deploy & Monitor) | Packaged module + monitoring setup | 10 days | Integration test passes; monitoring metrics configured |

**Total Estimated Duration: 57 days (~2 months)**

---

## 12. Cold-Start Handling
*Unlike the Forecaster and Anomaly Detector, this module does not require a separate ML cold-start hypothesis.* Day-0 users (no transaction history at all) are served by `QUESTIONNAIRE` mode (Section 0.2, Article VI §2), a deterministic mapping from questionnaire answers to an initial FBP — not a model inference path. This module's Tier 0-4 comparison only applies once `STANDARD` mode is reachable, i.e., once at least some transaction history exists. The boundary between the two is intentional: the questionnaire is the system's cold-start answer for this module, consistent with the Specification's own note (Article VI §3) that a separate ML cold-start fallback is likely unnecessary here.

---

## 13. Concept Drift & Assumptions
*Distinguish model-level drift (this module's learned parameters becoming stale) from user-level drift (Article IV §4, a person's own profile changing), which is a product feature, not a modeling concern.*

- **Model-Level Concept Drift:** The relationship between indirect/behavioral features and the ground-truth FBP label may shift as the target-user economy changes (inflation, minimum wage adjustments, growth of gig work). Monitor for this via the Section 10 drift metrics (PSI on input feature distributions, rolling per-class accuracy) applied specifically to the deployed candidate, whichever tier that turns out to be.
- **Key Assumption (synthetic-to-real gap):** All KPI figures in this document are measured on synthetic personas. Generalization to real users is untested until real prototype-user data is available (Section 2, Secondary source) and is treated as an explicit limitation of this design, not a guarantee.
- **Key Assumption (injected feature realism):** Indirect/behavioral features are manually injected into personas based on RRL citations and financial-expert judgment, not observed in FIES. Any performance gap between Tier 1 and the learned tiers is only as trustworthy as these injection rules; this is documented as a threat to validity rather than assumed away.

# Model Design Document - Forecaster
**Document Version:** v2.1  
**Module Name:** Forecaster  
**Author(s):** Guevarra
**Date:** 2026-07-16  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 0. Module Context & Isolation Boundary (The Invariant Contract)
*This section is non-negotiable and pre-defines the module's API boundaries. The rest of the document serves to realize this contract.*

### 0.1. Module Function
*Forecasts future expenses at total, category group, and category levels based on historical transaction data using deep learning and ensemble methods.*

### 0.2. Strict Input Contract (What the module receives)
- **Structure:** JSON
- **Required Fields:**

| Field | Type | Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `user_id` | String | Non-null, valid UUID format |
| `historical_transactions` | List[Object] | Non-empty list; each must contain amount, category, date, type |
| `forecast_horizon` | String | One of: `WEEKLY` (7 days), `SEMI_MONTHLY` (15 days), `MONTHLY` (30 days) |
| `forecast_level` | String | One of: `TOTAL`, `CATEGORY_GROUP`, `CATEGORY` |
| `target_categories` | List[String] | Optional; required if forecast_level is `CATEGORY`; list of category IDs |
| `user_metadata` | Object | Optional; demographic data for cold-start scenarios |

- **Rejection Criteria:**
  - Empty `historical_transactions`
  - Invalid `forecast_horizon` enum value
  - Invalid `forecast_level` value
  - `target_categories` empty when `forecast_level = CATEGORY`

> **Scope Note:** The module is limited to the three fixed horizons above (weekly, semi-monthly, monthly) rather than an arbitrary day count. This is a feasibility constraint, not a modeling preference: Variable-income users (freelancers, gig workers, project-based/contractual workers) report irregular and seasonal pay periods, so training and validating a single model against longer, arbitrary horizons is not achievable within the thesis timeline. Restricting the model to these three horizons keeps evaluation tractable and aligns forecasts to the pay-cycle boundaries most Filipino users actually plan around (weekly, semi-monthly "cutoff" pay, and monthly).

### 0.3. Strict Output Contract (What the module returns)
- **Structure:** JSON
- **Required Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `forecasts` | List[Object] | Array of forecast objects; each contains date, amount, and metadata |
| `forecast_level` | String | Echo of input forecast_level |
| `forecast_horizon` | String | Echo of input forecast_horizon (`WEEKLY`, `SEMI_MONTHLY`, or `MONTHLY`) |
| `confidence_intervals` | Object | Upper and lower bounds at 80% and 95% confidence |
| `model_version` | String | Version identifier of the model used |
| `status` | String | `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `FALLBACK` |

- **Guaranteed Behavior:** The module must never throw an unhandled exception. It must always return the structured contract (using fallback values if the model fails).

### 0.4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Out of Scope)
- **This module does NOT** manage user authentication or authorization.
- **This module does NOT** store forecast results in any database.
- **This module does NOT** provide budget recommendations (handled by Budget Recommender module).
- **This module does NOT** handle anomaly detection (handled by Anomaly Detector module).

---

## 1. Problem Statement (Scope, Objectives, and KPIs)
*Define the predictive problem in purely statistical/mathematical terms. Be agnostic about *how* to solve it.*

- **Core Problem:** Multi-step time series forecasting of expense amounts at hierarchical levels (total, category group, category), for three fixed horizons (weekly, semi-monthly, monthly), with heteroscedastic noise (variance increases with amount), seasonal patterns (weekly, semi-monthly, monthly), and potential concept drift over time. Longer or arbitrary horizons are explicitly out of scope: Variable-income users' irregular/seasonal pay cycles make longer-horizon targets unreliable to label and validate given the thesis timeline, so the module commits only to the three horizons above.

- **Quantitative Objectives (KPIs):**
  - **Primary:**
    - **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) < 5% at total level (Literature benchmark: NNAR achieved 2.67%, CNN-LSTM achieved 2.72% [Krstev et al., 2023; Ullah et al., 2024])
    - **MAPE** < 10% at category group level
    - **MAPE** < 15% at category level
  - **Secondary:**
    - **R²** > 0.85 (Literature benchmark: Ensemble achieved R² = 0.9921 [Sonkavde et al., 2023])
    - **RMSE** < 15% of mean daily spending
    - **Inference latency:** P95 < 1s (LSTM inference + post-processing)
    - **Compute budget:** RAM < 1GB, GPU optional (Literature: tree-based models are 126,934% faster to train than deep learning [Hall, 2025])
  - **Business Metrics:**
    - Forecast error reduction of at least 22% compared to heuristic baseline (Literature: ML models reduce prediction errors by 22-33% compared to heuristic forecasts [Bhavana et al., 2025])

- **Stakeholders:** The Forecasting Module (Article XXV) and Budgeting Module (Article XXI) consume the output.

---

## 2. Data Collection Plan (Sourcing, Types, and Sizes)
*Define what data is required to train this module, without committing to the final dataset.*

- **Sourcing Strategy:**
  - **Primary:** Historical transaction data from thesis prototype users (anonymized)
  - **Secondary:** Synthetic data generation with realistic spending patterns
  - **Tertiary:** Publicly available expense datasets for pre-training (e.g., PSA 2023 FIES microdata)

- **Required Data Types:**
  - **Time-series:** Daily aggregated expenses by category at total, group, and category levels
  - **Categorical:** Category hierarchies (PSA PCOICOP-based)
  - **Temporal:** Calendar features (day of week, month, holiday indicators, payday proximity)
  - **Transaction metadata:** Amount, category, date, type
  - **Demographic metadata:** Age, employment type, income range, FBP (for cold-start)

- **Minimum Viable Dataset Size:**
  - At least 1,500 days of transaction history aggregated across users
  - At least 50 users with >3 months of continuous transaction data
  - Minimum 50,000 transaction records
  - At least 500 transactions per category for category-level modeling

- **Labeling Strategy:**
  - Supervised (ground truth = future expenses)
  - No manual labeling required (historical data provides natural labels)
  - Time-series split: Training = first 70% of timeline, Validation = next 20%, Test = last 10%

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Specifications
*Identify potential data quality issues and the criteria for handling them. Explicitly keep the methods open-ended.*

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Missing days in transaction history (days with no transactions)
  - Irregular transaction frequencies (bulk recording of multiple transactions)
  - Outlier amounts (erroneous entries)
  - Category inconsistencies (user-defined vs. standard categories)
  - Seasonal effects (holidays, paydays affecting spending)
  - Zero or negative transaction amounts

- **Handling Criteria (Agnostic):**
  - *Decision Gate:* Evaluate impact of imputation vs. interpolation vs. deletion
  - *Candidate Techniques to Explore:*
    - **Missing values:** Linear interpolation for daily aggregates, forward-fill for categories (Literature: IQR-based detection with Q1 - 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR [Ullah et al., 2024])
    - **Outlier capping:** Winsorization at 99th percentile or IQR method
    - **Frequency normalization:** Resampling to daily frequency with aggregation
    - **De-seasonalization:** Decompose time series using STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess) [Thundiyil et al., 2025]
    - **Zero/negative amounts:** Filter out (invalid transaction)
    - **Seasonal adjustment:** Apply MSTL (Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition) for multi-seasonal periods [Williams et al., 2023]

- **Data Versioning:** Raw and cleaned time series stored with version tags; feature sets cached for reproducibility.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Plan
*State the hypotheses to test and the visualizations/investigations required before modeling.*

- **Hypotheses to Validate:**
  - Daily spending follows a weekly pattern (higher on weekends, paydays) - supported by literature [Ahmed & Dey, 2023]
  - Spending shows semi-monthly seasonality tied to the common 15th/end-of-month Philippine payroll cutoff, distinct from the broader monthly cycle
  - Monthly spending shows seasonality (higher at month start/end) - supported by literature [Williams et al., 2023]
  - Spending patterns differ across FBP classes - supported by literature [Sappa, 2024]
  - Autocorrelation exists at weekly (7-day), semi-monthly (15-day), and monthly (30-day) lags - supported by literature [Thundiyil et al., 2025]

- **Required Statistical Summaries:**
  - Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) - critical for understanding temporal dependencies [Song et al., 2025]
  - Daily spending distribution (mean, variance, skewness)
  - Temporal patterns: Day-of-week effects, month-of-year effects
  - Stationarity tests (ADF test for unit root) - literature notes non-stationarity is the norm in financial data [Paper 9, 2025]
  - Seasonal decomposition plots (trend, seasonal, residual components)

- **Correlation Targets:**
  - Spending vs. day of week - Literature: retained users show higher merchant diversity [Ahmed & Dey, 2023]
  - Spending vs. payday proximity
  - Category spending inter-correlations
  - Spending vs. user demographic features (age, employment type)

- **Outcome of this phase:** Determines whether to use ARIMA-style autoregressive features, seasonal decomposition, or deep learning approaches [Song et al., 2025].

---

## 5. Feature Engineering Strategy
*Define the target feature space dimensions and the strategies to compare.*

- **Feature Encoding Candidates:**
  - **Temporal encoding:** Day of week (sin/cos), month (sin/cos), day of year, hour (if sub-daily)
  - **Lag features:** Previous 1, 7, 14, 15, 30, 60, 90 days of spending - literature shows temporal order is critical (disrupting order causes up to 1092% MSE increase [Song et al., 2025])
  - **Rolling statistics:** 7-day, 14-day, 15-day, 30-day moving averages and standard deviations
  - **Calendar features:** Payday indicators, holiday indicators, payday proximity
  - **RFM metrics:** Recency, Frequency, Monetary value - identified as most predictive features [Ahmed & Dey, 2023; Paper 32]

- **Derived Features:**
  - Day-over-day change (momentum)
  - Spending volatility (rolling standard deviation)
  - Category-level spending ratios (proportion of total)
  - Weekday vs. weekend spending ratio
  - Inter-transaction gaps - literature shows retained users have shorter gaps (11.2 days vs 34.7 days) [Ahmed & Dey, 2023]
  - Merchant diversity score - literature shows retained users have higher diversity (M=6.8 vs 2.9) [Ahmed & Dey, 2023]

- **Decomposition Features:**
  - **STL decomposition:** Trend, seasonal, and residual components [Thundiyil et al., 2025]
  - **MSTL:** Multiple seasonal periods for daily + weekly patterns [Williams et al., 2023]

- **Scaling Candidates:**
  - **Min-Max scaling** (to [0,1] range) - for neural network compatibility
  - **Standardization** (Z-score) - for LSTM compatibility
  - **Robust scaling** (using median and IQR) - less sensitive to outliers

- **Dimensionality Reduction Candidates:**
  - Feature selection: SHAP importance on XGBoost - literature shows SHAP-guided selection reduced features from 86 to 10 (88.5% reduction) while maintaining comparable performance [Schwartz et al., 2024]
  - Genetic Algorithm for optimal feature subset - literature shows GA increased AUC by 21% compared to using all features [Almonteros et al., 2024]
  - Target: 10-15 features (literature shows 7-12 features capture most discriminatory information, peaking at 86% accuracy [Lien & Rajasekharan, 2024])

- **Constraint:** Feature engineering must fit within memory/compute constraints; avoid creating excessive lag features that increase inference time.

## 6. Data Modeling Strategy (Algorithm Selection & Baseline)
*Define the tiered approach to modeling. **Crucially**, do not select the final model here; define the selection criteria.*

- **Tier 1: Baseline Model (Must-Have):**
  - **ARIMA** (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) - literature: superior for small, linear, or strongly seasonal datasets [Kontopoulou et al., 2023]
  - **ETS** (Exponential Smoothing) - literature: strong baseline for seasonal data (MAPE 3.28%) [Krstev et al., 2023]
  - **Prophet** - literature: achieved lowest weighted error (10.456) vs ARIMA, LSTM [Mariano & Monreal, 2025]
  - Purpose: Establish statistical model baseline

- **Tier 2: Intermediate Model:**
  - **XGBoost Regressor** with lag and calendar features - literature: XGBoost outperforms ARIMA and LSTM in some settings (MSE 360.0) [Sonkavde et al., 2023]
  - **LightGBM** - literature: provides best balance between forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency [Paper 85]; tree-based models are 126,934% faster to train than deep learning [Hall, 2025]
  - **Random Forest Regressor** - literature: 0.9208 R² for poverty prediction [Onsay & Rabajante, 2024]
  - Purpose: Tree-based ensemble performance; fast training for mobile-first constraints

- **Tier 3: Advanced Model:**
  - **LSTM** - literature: LSTM achieved 4.82% MAPE vs 20.97% for ARIMA [Ao & Fayek, 2023]; effective for capturing long-term dependencies [Casolaro et al., 2023]
  - **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Unit) - literature: offers comparable accuracy with lower compute than LSTM [Singh U. et al., 2025]
  - **BiLSTM** (Bidirectional LSTM) - literature: captures both forward and backward dependencies
  - **Transformer-based variants** (if needed) - literature: PatchTST achieves 23% lower MSE than Informer with 60% less GPU memory [Song et al., 2025]
  - **Hybrid Models** - literature: ARIMA-NARNN reduced RMSE by 35.3% vs ARIMA alone [Kontopoulou et al., 2023]; LSTM-Logistic Regression achieved AUC-ROC of 0.91 [Paper 65, 2025]
  - Justification: LSTM is specified in the title; handles sequential dependencies and long-term patterns

- **Selection Criteria:**
  - Lowest MAPE within latency budget
  - Must beat ARIMA baseline by at least 20% reduction in MAPE (Literature benchmark: ML models reduce error by 22-33% [Bhavana et al., 2025])
  - Model size must be deployable (<500MB)
  - For mobile-first constraints, prioritize LightGBM or GRU over full LSTM [Hall, 2025]

---

## 7. Model Evaluation Plan
*Define the rigorous methodology to compare models fairly, without predefining the outcomes.*

- **Primary Evaluation Metric:**
  - **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) at the specified forecast level - literature: recommended for scale-independent comparison [Krstev et al., 2023; Ullah et al., 2024]
  - Justification: Interpretable as percentage error; comparable across different spending levels

- **Secondary Metrics:**
  - **R²** - literature: coefficient of determination for fit quality [Sonkavde et al., 2023]
  - **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) - literature: penalizes large errors heavily [Ullah et al., 2024]
  - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) - literature: robust, intuitive metric [Bhavana et al., 2025]
  - **Inference time** (P95 latency) - literature: critical for mobile-first applications [Hall, 2025]
  - **Model size** (MB) - literature: 91% of ML models degrade in production, often within days [Paper 97, 2025]

- **Validation Strategy:**
  - **Time-series split:** Training set = first 80% of timeline, Validation set = next 10%, Test set = last 10%
  - **Walk-forward validation:** Training on increasing windows, evaluating one step ahead - literature: recommended for time series to prevent information leakage [Paper 9, 2025]
  - **Rolling forecast evaluation:** Forecast N days, compare to actual, roll forward
  - **Purged cross-validation:** To prevent information leakage [Paper 60, 2025]

- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:**
  - Not applicable for regression; analyze:
    - Error distribution (bias: under/over-forecasting patterns)
    - Error by category (identify categories where model underperforms)
    - Error by user FBP (identify profile-specific performance differences)

---

## 8. Optimization Strategy (Tuning & Ensembling)
*Define the hyperparameter landscape and optimization budget.*

- **Tuning Candidates:**
  - **Random Search** - preferred for LSTM due to many hyperparameters
  - **Bayesian Optimization** - if compute budget allows
  - **Grid Search** - for tree-based models with limited hyperparameters

- **Hyperparameter Space for LSTM:**
  - `n_layers`: [1, 2, 3]
  - `n_units`: [32, 64, 128, 256] - literature: GRU offers comparable accuracy with lower compute [Singh U. et al., 2025]
  - `dropout`: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
  - `batch_size`: [16, 32, 64]
  - `learning_rate`: [0.001, 0.01]
  - `sequence_length`: [7, 14, 15, 30, 60] (lookback window) - literature: lookback window of 24-336 time steps [Song et al., 2025; Ullah et al., 2024]
  - `activation`: ['tanh', 'relu']

- **Hyperparameter Space for XGBoost/LightGBM:**
  - `n_estimators`: [100, 200, 500]
  - `max_depth`: [3, 5, 7, 10] - literature: XGBoost achieved high F1 (0.680) and AUC (0.872) [Paper 14, 2025]
  - `learning_rate`: [0.01, 0.1, 0.3]
  - `min_child_weight`: [1, 3, 5]
  - `subsample`: [0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
  - `colsample_bytree`: [0.8, 0.9, 1.0]

- **Ensemble Candidates:**
  - **Weighted averaging** of LSTM and XGBoost predictions - literature: ensemble techniques generally provide superior performance over standalone models [Sonkavde et al., 2023]
  - **Stacking:** Linear regression meta-model on LSTM + XGBoost outputs
  - **Voting ensemble** of multiple models - literature: Voting Ensemble achieved highest R² (78.11%) [Thakur & Jadhav, 2025]
  - **Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM** - literature: hybrid frameworks improve forecasting robustness by combining linear and non-linear modeling [Paper 53, 2025]
  - Tested only if single model plateaus below KPI

- **Optimization Budget:**
  - Max 50 trials per model for Random Search
  - Max 30 iterations for Bayesian Optimization
  - Ensemble optimization after individual models are tuned

---

## 9. Deployment Strategy & Module Packaging
*Define how the finished model will be delivered as a module, without choosing the specific cloud provider.*

- **Interface Requirement:**
  - Python function: `predict(input: Dict) -> Dict`
  - Must strictly adhere to Section 0 contract
  - Async support for concurrent requests
  - Lightweight inference runtime (<500MB RAM) for mobile-first constraints [Hall, 2025]

- **Artifact Delivery:**
  - **LSTM weights:** `.h5` or `.pth` format
  - **Preprocessing pipeline:** `.pkl` or `.joblib`
  - **Scaler and feature transformer:** serialized as above
  - **Model version metadata:** training data hash, performance metrics, creation date
  - **Fallback model:** ARIMA/ETS statistical model for cold-start

- **Integration Point:**
  - **Containerized API service** (FastAPI preferred for async support) - literature: inference latency critical for user experience [Hall, 2025]
  - Called by mobile app via REST API
  - Dependency injection for model loading at startup
  - **Lightweight screening at edge** - detect potential concept drift before sending to cloud [Paper 26, 2025]

- **Deployment Candidates:**
  - **Docker container** (preferred for reproducibility)
  - **Serverless function** (if latency requirements can be met)
  - **Decision:** Docker on dedicated instance with GPU optional; fallback to CPU-only for cost optimization
  - **Mobile-first:** Consider exporting GRU model to TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference [Hall, 2025]

---

## 10. Model Monitoring & Lifecycle Plan
*Define how we will know the module is degrading over time, without specifying the monitoring tool.*

- **Metrics to Track Post-Deployment:**
  - *Input Drift:* Monitor distribution changes in feature values (lagged spending, calendar features) - literature: use Population Stability Index (PSI) with threshold 10% [Paper 9, 2025]
  - *Output Drift:* Monitor prediction confidence intervals and forecast variance
  - *Performance:* Compare forecasts to actuals (MAPE, RMSE) on weekly basis
  - *Concept Drift:* Detect using ADWIN, DDM, or Page-Hinkley - literature: 91% of ML models degrade in production [Paper 97, 2025]

- **Drift Detection Methods:**
  - **Hybrid detection:** CUSUM for abrupt drift + moving average for gradual drift - literature: detection delay 31.2 instances for abrupt, 64.8 for gradual [Yashwanth et al., 2023]
  - **SEED and STEPD** - literature: consistently outperform other drift detectors [Paper 34, 2025]
  - **Adaptive thresholding** - literature: adjusts sensitivity based on stream volatility [Yashwanth et al., 2023]

- **Retraining Triggers:**
  - Rolling MAPE > 20% for 3 consecutive weeks at total level
  - Significant input drift detected (PSI > 0.1)
  - Major changes in user behavior (e.g., new job, relocation)
  - **Severity-aware retraining:** Quantile transformation reduces unnecessary retraining - literature: 93% of features exhibited significant drift [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025]

- **Adaptation Strategies:**
  - **Sliding-window retraining** - literature: improves AUC by up to 5 percentage points during volatile periods [Paper 29, 2025]
  - **Parameter updates** - literature: faster than structural updates [Xiang et al., 2023]
  - **Model reuse pool** - literature: Pool ICM reduced retraining events by up to 94% [Eliades & Papadopoulos, 2025]
  - **Online adaptive RNN** - literature: effective for load forecasting under concept drift [Xiang et al., 2023]

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Actual transaction data used to compute forecast accuracy
  - Errors flagged for model improvement
  - User feedback on forecast accuracy collected via app (optional)
  - **Monthly retraining** with latest data - literature: continuous curation and periodic retraining maintain performance near peak levels (sawtooth pattern) [Paper 97, 2025]

- **Evaluation Metrics for Drift:**
  - **OldTransfer** (knowledge preservation) - literature: GEM achieved 0.1785 OldTransfer on Forest Cover [Pai et al., 2024]
  - **NewTransfer** (adaptation to new data) - literature: critical for measuring adaptation performance [Pai et al., 2024]
  - **Backward Transfer (BWT)** - measures forgetting [Martin et al., 2023]

## 11. Timeline, Dependencies, and Decision Gates
*Break down the 10 phases into a realistic schedule for the thesis project.*

| Phase | Deliverable | Estimated Duration | Success Gate (Go/No-Go) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 & 3 (Data) | Cleaned, versioned time series | 14 days | Data passes quality checks; minimum 1,500 days of history; IQR outlier handling validated |
| 4 & 5 (EDA & Features) | Feature matrix ready; EDA report | 10 days | EDA confirms weekly/semi-monthly/monthly seasonality; ACF/PACF analysis complete; SHAP feature importance identified |
| 6 & 7 (Modeling & Eval) | Baseline + Intermediate results | 14 days | ARIMA baseline established; XGBoost/LightGBM beats ARIMA by >20% MAPE reduction [Bhavana et al., 2025] |
| 8 (Optimization) | Final optimized model | 10 days | Final model meets KPI: MAPE < 5% at total level [Krstev et al., 2023; Ullah et al., 2024] |
| 9 & 10 (Deploy & Monitor) | Packaged module + monitoring setup | 10 days | Integration test passes; drift detection (ADWIN/CUSUM) configured; monitoring metrics configured |

**Total Estimated Duration: 58 days (~2 months)**

---

## 12. Cold-Start Hypothesis
*Define how the module handles new users with limited or no historical data.*

- **Core Hypothesis:** New users can be modeled using demographic proxies, synthetic data generation, or zero-shot transfer learning until sufficient transaction history is accumulated.

- **Strategies:**
  1. **Zero-shot forecasting with TEMPO** - literature: pre-trained transformer with decomposition and soft prompts; achieved 6.5% MAE improvement on Weather dataset, 19.1% on ETTm1 [Cao et al., 2024]
  2. **Self-supervised learning (SSL)** - literature: learns representations from unlabeled data; achieved AUC 0.91 for credit risk vs XGBoost's 0.84 [Yachamaneni et al., 2025]
  3. **Synthetic data generation** - literature: PAnDA framework using LLMs achieved 37.55% improvement in Recall@10 on sparse datasets [Paper 77, 2025]
  4. **Knowledge transfer via GCN** - literature: TechCD framework enables zero-shot cognitive diagnosis; achieved 56.73% ACC with out-domain data [Gao et al., 2023]
  5. **Behavioral profiling** - use user-declared preferences and demographic data (age, employment type, FBP) as proxies
  6. **Default fallback** - use ARIMA/ETS statistical model until enough data is available - literature: simple models often perform comparably to complex models when data is limited [Krstev et al., 2023]

- **Combined Approach:**
  - **Immediate:** Zero-shot TEMPO or SSL-based representation using only demographic features
  - **First 30 days:** Hybrid ARIMA + demographic proxy features
  - **After 3 months:** Full LSTM or ensemble model with personalized features
  - **Dynamic update:** User profile continuously updated as actual data arrives

---

## 13. Concept Drift & Assumptions
*Define how the module handles changing user behavior and economic conditions over time.*

- **Core Assumption:** Non-stationarity is the norm in financial data, not the exception. Static models degrade over time and require continuous adaptation.

- **Types of Drift to Handle:**
  - **Abrupt drift** - sudden changes (e.g., job change, pandemic) - literature: parameter updates preferred [Hovakimyan & Bravo, 2024]
  - **Gradual drift** - slow changes over time (e.g., lifestyle changes) - literature: detected via moving average [Hovakimyan & Bravo, 2024]
  - **Recurring drift** - past distributions reappear (e.g., seasonal patterns) - literature: least addressed; model reuse pool can handle [Eliades & Papadopoulos, 2025]

- **Detection Methods:**
  - **ADWIN** (ADaptive WINdowing) - literature: with incremental learning dominates on gradual drift [Paper 30, 2025]
  - **DDM** (Drift Detection Method) - literature: reacts fastest to abrupt shifts [Paper 30, 2025]
  - **CUSUM** - literature: for abrupt drift detection [Yashwanth et al., 2023]
  - **Hybrid approach** - CUSUM + moving average; detection delay 31.2 instances for abrupt, 64.8 for gradual [Yashwanth et al., 2023]

- **Adaptation Strategies:**
  1. **Sliding-window retraining** - literature: improves AUC by up to 5 percentage points during volatile periods [Paper 29, 2025]
  2. **Parameter updates** - literature: faster than structural updates [Xiang et al., 2023]
  3. **Model reuse pool** - literature: Pool ICM reduced retraining events by up to 94% [Eliades & Papadopoulos, 2025]
  4. **Severity-aware adaptation** - literature: quantile transformation reduced KS statistic from 0.0559 to 0.0072 [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025]
  5. **Lifelong learning (GEM)** - literature: outperforms others in preserving old knowledge (0.1785 OldTransfer) [Pai et al., 2024]

- **Monitoring Metrics:**
  - **OldTransfer** - knowledge preservation [Pai et al., 2024]
  - **NewTransfer** - adaptation to new data [Pai et al., 2024]
  - **F1-score on post-drift classification** - literature: 0.89 achieved with hybrid detection [Yashwanth et al., 2023]
  - **False positive rate** - literature: 0.041 vs ADWIN's 0.147 [Yashwanth et al., 2023]

- **Key Recommendation:** Hierarchical architecture combining:
  1. **Lightweight screening at edge** - flag potential shifts [Paper 26, 2025]
  2. **Rigorous validation in cloud** - with severity-aware thresholds [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025]
  3. **Feedback loop** - refine model and re-deploy [Paper 26, 2025]

**Document Version:** v2.0  
**Module Name:** Anomaly Detector  
**Author(s):** Guevarra
**Date:** 2026-07-16  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 0. Module Context & Isolation Boundary (The Invariant Contract)
*This section is non-negotiable and pre-defines the module's API boundaries. The rest of the document serves to realize this contract.*

### 0.1. Module Function
*Detects anomalous transactions (unusual spending patterns) and overspending transactions (exceeding category budgets) using unsupervised anomaly detection and rule-based thresholding.*

### 0.2. Strict Input Contract (What the module receives)
- **Structure:** JSON
- **Required Fields:**

| Field | Type | Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `user_id` | String | Non-null, valid UUID format |
| `transactions` | List[Object] | Non-empty list; each must contain amount, category, date, type, category_group |
| `detection_type` | String | One of: `ANOMALOUS`, `OVERSPENDING`, `BOTH` |
| `budget_allocations` | List[Object] | Required if detection_type is `OVERSPENDING` or `BOTH`; contains category budget amounts |
| `whitelist` | List[Object] | Optional; user-defined exclusions |

- **Rejection Criteria:**
  - Empty `transactions` list
  - Invalid `detection_type` value
  - Missing `budget_allocations` when detection_type = `OVERSPENDING` or `BOTH`
  - Transaction missing required fields (amount, category, date)
  - Zero or negative transaction amounts (filtered out)

### 0.3. Strict Output Contract (What the module returns)
- **Structure:** JSON
- **Required Fields:**

| `confidence` | Float | Calibrated confidence score between 0 and 1 |
| `status` | String | `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `FALLBACK` |

- **Guaranteed Behavior:** The module must never throw an unhandled exception. It must always return the structured contract (using fallback values if the model fails).

### 0.4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Out of Scope)
- **This module does NOT** manage user settings or whitelist preferences (handled by Anomaly Detection Module UI).
- **This module does NOT** send notifications (handled by Notifications Module).
- **This module does NOT** take remedial actions on flagged transactions.
- **This module does NOT** interact with external microservices during inference.
- **This module does NOT** perform forecasting or budget recommendations.

---

## 1. Problem Statement (Scope, Objectives, and KPIs)
*Define the predictive problem in purely statistical/mathematical terms. Be agnostic about *how* to solve it.*

- **Core Problem:** Two-layer anomaly detection: (1) identify transactions that are statistically unusual given the user's historical spending patterns, and (2) identify transactions that exceed budget constraints. The system must handle extreme class imbalance (anomalies < 1-5% of transactions), concept drift (changing spending patterns), and cold-start scenarios (new users with limited history).

- **Quantitative Objectives (KPIs):**
  - **Primary (Anomalous Detection):**
    - **F1-Score** ≥ 0.85 (Literature benchmark: TA-IFDC achieved 0.927 [Huang A. et al., 2025]; SSL+Hybrid achieved 0.96 [Al Rafi, 2024])
    - **Recall** ≥ 0.85 (Literature benchmark: CS-DNN achieved 0.82-0.91 recall [Serdan, 2025])
    - **False Positive Rate** ≤ 5% (Literature benchmark: TA-IFDC achieved 0.041 FPR [Huang A. et al., 2025]; DataStream Adapt achieved 0.041 FPR [Yashwanth et al., 2023])
    - **AUC-ROC** ≥ 0.90 (Literature benchmark: Autoencoder achieved 0.971 [Fariha et al., 2025])
  - **Secondary (Overspending Detection):**
    - **Precision** = 100% (Rule-based, deterministic)
    - **Recall** = 100% (No false negatives by design)
  - **Operational:**
    - **Inference latency:** P95 < 300ms (Literature benchmark: Hybrid routing achieves <10-100ms for real-time [Ahmed et al., 2025; Abd-Ellatif et al., 2025])
    - **Compute budget:** RAM < 500MB, no GPU required (Literature: LightGBM achieves 0.58ms latency with low resource usage [Shaha & Gavekar, 2025])
  - **Business Metrics:**
    - **Early Detection Rate** > 70% within first quarter (Literature benchmark: HFSL achieved 0.726 EDR [Zhang & Duan, 2025])
    - **Cost Savings:** Cost-sensitive optimization should prioritize recall over precision, with `C_fn >> C_fp` [Karthikeyan et al., 2026]

- **Stakeholders:** The Anomaly Detection Module (Article XXIX) and Notifications Module (Article XXXV) consume the output.

---

## 2. Data Collection Plan (Sourcing, Types, and Sizes)
*Define what data is required to train this module, without committing to the final dataset.*

- **Sourcing Strategy:**
  - **Primary:** Historical transaction data from thesis prototype users (anonymized)
  - **Secondary:** Synthetic anomaly injection: Manually insert anomalous transactions into normal data (Literature: synthetic anomaly injection is standard practice [Chen & Lin, 2025])
  - **Tertiary:** Publicly available fraud detection datasets for pre-training (e.g., credit card fraud datasets)

- **Required Data Types:**
  - **Transaction data:** Amount, category, date, category group, merchant category
  - **Historical context:** Previous transaction amounts by category (minimum 3 months recommended)
  - **Budget data:** Category budgets (allocation amounts and periods)
  - **Behavioral features:** Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM), inter-transaction gaps
  - **Labels:** Binary (anomalous vs. normal) for supervised training of ensemble models
  - **Demographic metadata:** Age, employment type, FBP (for cold-start)

- **Minimum Viable Dataset Size:**
  - At least 100,000 transaction records (Literature: models trained on large datasets generalize better [Boniol et al., 2024])
  - At least 5% anomalous transactions (synthetic or real) - literature shows fraud prevalence is typically <1-5% [George et al., 2023]
  - At least 500 transactions per category for category-level modeling
  - At least 50 users with >3 months of continuous transaction data

- **Labeling Strategy:**
  - **Semi-supervised:** Normal data assumed to be clean; anomalies injected synthetically
  - **Manual labeling:** Candidate anomalies labeled by domain experts for validation
  - **Self-supervised:** Contrastive and masked objectives for unsupervised learning (Literature: SSL achieves F1=0.96 without labels [Al Rafi, 2024])

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Specifications
*Identify potential data quality issues and the criteria for handling them. Explicitly keep the methods open-ended.*

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Missing category information
  - Zero or negative transaction amounts
  - Duplicate transactions
  - Whitelist exclusions (user-defined)
  - Concept drift in transaction patterns
  - Seasonal variations (holiday spending, payday patterns)

- **Handling Criteria (Agnostic):**
  - *Decision Gate:* Evaluate impact of removing vs. imputing missing categories
  - *Candidate Techniques to Explore:*
    - **Missing categories:** Impute as "UNKNOWN" category (excluded from detection) - literature: missingness is predictive and should be treated as signal rather than noise [Chen et al., 2024]
    - **Zero/negative amounts:** Filter out (invalid transaction)
    - **Duplicates:** Deduplicate via exact + fuzzy matching
    - **Whitelist:** Pre-filter transactions matching whitelist criteria
    - **Outlier capping:** IQR method (Q1 - 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR) [Ullah et al., 2024]
    - **Seasonal adjustment:** Apply MSTL (Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition) for multi-seasonal periods [Williams et al., 2023]
    - **Missingness indicators:** Create binary flags for missing values (literature shows missingness can be more predictive than many financial ratios [Chen et al., 2024])

- **Data Versioning:** Preprocessed datasets stored with version tags; whitelist applied at inference time.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Plan
*State the hypotheses to test and the visualizations/investigations required before modeling.*

- **Hypotheses to Validate:**
  - Transaction amount distributions by category are log-normal - supported by literature [Fariha et al., 2025]
  - Anomalous transactions are rare (<5% of total) - supported by literature [George et al., 2023]
  - Spending patterns differ by FBP - supported by literature [Sappa, 2024]
  - Outliers in amount are often legitimate (e.g., medical emergencies, large purchases)
  - Behavioral features are more predictive than monetary features - literature: behavioral variables significantly improved model fit (χ²=145.5, p<0.001) while monetary variables did not [Hopfgartner et al., 2024]
  - Temporal patterns exist (late-night transactions have highest risk score of 0.72) [Fariha et al., 2025]

- **Required Statistical Summaries:**
  - Amount distribution per category (mean, median, variance, percentiles)
  - Transaction frequency by category
  - Inter-transaction time distribution
  - Category-wise outlier detection using IQR
  - Temporal patterns (hour of day, day of week, seasonal) - literature: fraud peaks late-night and weekends [Luong & Xie, 2026]
  - Feature correlations and multicollinearity

- **Correlation Targets:**
  - Transaction amount vs. category
  - Transaction amount vs. day of week/month
  - Spending vs. budget allocation ratios
  - Behavioral features vs. anomaly labels

- **Outcome of this phase:** Determines if amount distributions warrant log-transformation, which features are most predictive, and how to handle seasonal outliers.

---

## 5. Feature Engineering Strategy
*Define the target feature space dimensions and the strategies to compare.*

- **Feature Encoding Candidates:**
  - **Amount:** Raw, log-transformed, Z-score normalized
  - **Category:** One-Hot Encoding or target encoding
  - **Temporal:** Day of week (sin/cos), hour of day (sin/cos), month, holiday indicators - literature: late-night transactions (0-6 AM) have highest risk score of 0.72 [Fariha et al., 2025]
  - **Behavioral:** Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) - literature: RFM features are most predictive [Ahmed & Dey, 2023; Paper 32]

- **Derived Features:**
  - **Amount deviation:** `(amount - category_mean) / category_std` - literature: amount deviation from cardholder average is discriminative [Fariha et al., 2025]
  - **Category-specific percentile rank**
  - **Rolling average deviation:** `amount - 7-day moving average`
  - **Category frequency:** how often category appears in user's history
  - **Amount relative to budget:** `amount / budget_allocation`
  - **Inter-transaction gap:** days since last transaction
  - **Hesitation index:** time between transaction start and completion - literature: hesitation index improves churn prediction from 61% to 86% [Paper 52, 2025]
  - **Behavioral volatility:** standard deviation of transaction amounts over rolling window - literature: behavioral volatility is predictive of risk [Islam et al., 2025]
  - **Merchant diversity score** - literature: retained users have higher diversity (M=6.8 vs 2.9) [Ahmed & Dey, 2023]
  - **Trust-weighted embeddings** combining long-term and short-term behavior - literature: BTVE adapts to behavioral drift with automatic retraining [Paper 63, 2025]
  - **Wallet balance trend** - literature: factor of 1.74x over other features [Olabintan, 2026]

- **Missingness Indicators:**
  - Binary flags for missing features - literature: Missing(Attr27) was highly predictive—more so than many financial ratios [Chen et al., 2024]

- **Scaling Candidates:**
  - **Standardization** (for Isolation Forest compatibility)
  - **Min-Max scaling** (to [0,1] range)
  - **Robust scaling** (using median and IQR) - less sensitive to outliers

- **Dimensionality Reduction Candidates:**
  - **PCA** (to preserve 90-95% variance) - literature: PCA effectively reduces dimensionality for anomaly detection [Li et al., 2026]
  - **Feature selection:** SHAP importance on XGBoost - literature: SHAP-guided selection reduced features from 86 to 10 (88.5% reduction) while maintaining comparable performance [Schwartz et al., 2024]
  - **Genetic Algorithm** for optimal feature subset - literature: GA increased AUC by 21% compared to using all features [Almonteros et al., 2024]
  - **Target: 7-12 features** - literature shows this captures most discriminatory information (peaking at 86% accuracy) [Lien & Rajasekharan, 2024]

- **Constraint:** Feature engineering must fit within memory/compute constraints; avoid creating too many features that increase inference time.

## 6. Data Modeling Strategy (Algorithm Selection & Baseline)
*Define the tiered approach to modeling. **Crucially**, do not select the final model here; define the selection criteria.*

- **Tier 1: Baseline Model (Must-Have):**
  - **IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) rule-based detection:** median ± 3×IQR
  - **Purpose:** Establish simple statistical baseline
  - **Expected performance:** F1 < 0.50 (limitation of simple rules)

- **Tier 2: Intermediate Model (Unsupervised):**
  - **Isolation Forest** - literature: efficient for high-dimensional data; achieves 95.3% detection rate with 4.8% FPR [Zhong, 2025]; isolates anomalies via random partitioning [Fariha et al., 2025]
  - **Autoencoder** - literature: reconstruction error as anomaly score; highest AUC-ROC (0.971) among unsupervised methods [Fariha et al., 2025]
  - **One-Class SVM** - literature: useful for cold-start scenarios [Bader & Haraty, 2025]
  - **Purpose:** Unsupervised anomaly detection; establish unsupervised baselines

- **Tier 3: Advanced Model (Primary):**
  - **Hybrid Ensemble** - literature: ensemble methods consistently outperform single algorithms [Luong & Xie, 2026; Kashif & Naseer, 2025]
    - **LightGBM + Isolation Forest:** Combines supervised and unsupervised detection
    - **XGBoost + DNN ensemble:** Achieved F1-score of 0.74 with 0.35ms inference time [Luong & Xie, 2026]
    - **Voting Ensemble:** Combined multiple classifiers; achieved 99.904% accuracy [Vijayanand & Smrithy, 2025]
  - **Temporal-Attention Isolation Forest with Dynamic Calibration (TA-IFDC):** - literature: achieved F1=0.927, AUC=0.974, FPR=0.041 [Huang A. et al., 2025]
    - Uses dynamic threshold calibration: `θ_k = (1-λ)θ_{k-1} + λ Quantile_β(𝒮_k)`
    - Maintains stable alert rates during seasonal traffic shifts
  - **Cost-Sensitive Deep Neural Network (CS-DNN):** - literature: improved recall from 0.58 to 0.82 with 10:1 cost ratio; recall 0.91 with 50:1 ratio [Serdan, 2025]
  - **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):** - literature: achieves F1=0.96 with SSL+Hybrid; addresses cold-start by learning from behavior [Al Rafi, 2024; Zhang & Duan, 2025]
  - **Purpose:** State-of-the-art anomaly detection with concept drift handling

- **Tier 4: Sequential Pattern Detection (Optional):**
  - **Hybrid CNN-LSTM (ATAD-Net):** - literature: achieved 98.65% accuracy with 8.2ms latency [Abd-Ellatif et al., 2025]
  - **LSTM with Reinforcement Learning (RLFD):** - literature: uniquely detects sequential fraud missed by GBT; achieved 0.549 fraud recall vs 0.226 for GBT [Papanastassiou et al., 2026]
  - **Purpose:** Capture temporal dependencies in spending behavior; essential for detecting sequential anomalies

- **Selection Criteria:**
  - Highest F1-Score within latency budget (target: F1 ≥ 0.85)
  - Must beat IQR baseline by at least 50% improvement in F1
  - Low false-positive rate (critical for user trust)
  - Model size must be deployable (<200MB for mobile-first constraints) [Hall, 2025]
  - Cost-sensitive optimization: `τ* = argmin C(τ)` where `C(τ) = C_FN·FN(τ) + C_FP·FP(τ)` [Karthikeyan et al., 2026]

---

## 7. Model Evaluation Plan
*Define the rigorous methodology to compare models fairly, without predefining the outcomes.*

- **Primary Evaluation Metric:**
  - **F1-Score** (anomalous class) - literature: balances precision (avoid false alarms) and recall (catch anomalies) [Kalideen, 2025]
  - **Justification:** F1 provides balanced view of performance on minority class

- **Secondary Metrics:**
  - **Precision** - literature: users are sensitive to false positives; 0.98 precision achieved in fraud detection [Al Rafi, 2024]
  - **Recall** - literature: prioritize catching anomalies; 0.886-0.918 recall achieved [Sahraoui & Zari, 2025]
  - **AUC-ROC** - literature: threshold-independent measure; 0.97 achieved by autoencoder [Fariha et al., 2025]
  - **AUC-PR** - literature: more informative for highly imbalanced data [George et al., 2023]
  - **False Positive Rate** - literature: 0.041 achieved by TA-IFDC [Huang A. et al., 2025]
  - **Inference time** (P95 latency) - literature: <10-100ms for real-time [Ahmed et al., 2025]
  - **Cost Savings** - literature: cost-sensitive optimization should minimize `C = c_fp × FP + c_fn × FN` [Karthikeyan et al., 2026]
  - **Early Detection Rate** - literature: 0.726 within first two quarters [Zhang & Duan, 2025]

- **Validation Strategy:**
  - **Stratified K-Fold (k=5)** to maintain anomaly ratio
  - **Time-series split** for temporal generalization (train: first 80%, validate: next 10%, test: last 10%)
  - **Out-of-time validation** - literature: out-of-time validation (OR=2.83) is a strong predictor of reliable performance [Moury, 2026]
  - **Contamination parameter tuning** to adjust sensitivity (contamination rate: 1-5%)

- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:**
  - **False positives** (legitimate transactions flagged as anomalies) - critical for user trust; literature: reduced false positives by 30-40% post-deployment with regularization via complaint rates [Paper 98, 2025]
  - **False negatives** (missed anomalies) - important for catching issues; cost-sensitive optimization improves recall [Serdan, 2025]

- **Range Metrics for Sequential Anomalies:**
  - **Range-AUC** and **Volume Under the Surface (VUS)** - literature: more robust than point metrics for subsequence anomalies; point-adjust inflates F-measure by 27-31% [Boniol et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023]

---

## 8. Optimization Strategy (Tuning & Ensembling)
*Define the hyperparameter landscape and optimization budget.*

- **Tuning Candidates:**
  - **Grid Search** (exhaustive, but limited to small search spaces)
  - **Random Search** (preferred for larger hyperparameter spaces)
  - **Bayesian Optimization** (if compute budget allows)

- **Hyperparameter Space for Isolation Forest:**
  - `n_estimators`: [100, 200, 300] - literature: higher estimators improve performance [Zhong, 2025]
  - `max_samples`: ['auto', 0.5, 0.8]
  - `contamination`: [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15] (auto or float)
  - `bootstrap`: [True, False]
  - `random_state`: Fixed for reproducibility

- **Hyperparameter Space for Autoencoder:**
  - `n_layers`: [2, 3, 4]
  - `n_units`: [32, 64, 128]
  - `dropout`: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
  - `learning_rate`: [0.001, 0.01]
  - `activation`: ['relu', 'tanh']

- **Hyperparameter Space for XGBoost/LightGBM:**
  - `n_estimators`: [100, 200, 300] - literature: LightGBM achieved 0.981 ROC-AUC with 0.58ms latency [Shaha & Gavekar, 2025]
  - `max_depth`: [3, 5, 7, 10]
  - `learning_rate`: [0.01, 0.1, 0.3]
  - `class_weight`: ['balanced', None]
  - `scale_pos_weight`: [1, 2, 5, 10] (for handling imbalance)

- **Threshold Optimization:**
  - **Cost-sensitive threshold:** `τ* = argmin C(τ)` where `C(τ) = C_FN·FN(τ) + C_FP·FP(τ)` [Karthikeyan et al., 2026]
  - **Dynamic calibration:** `θ_k = (1-λ)θ_{k-1} + λ Quantile_β(𝒮_k)` [Huang A. et al., 2025]
  - **Adaptive threshold controller:** `h_t = h_0 · (1 + λ · ν_t)` adjusts sensitivity based on stream volatility [Yashwanth et al., 2023]

- **Ensemble Candidates:**
  - **Weighted averaging** of Isolation Forest and Autoencoder
  - **Voting ensemble** of multiple classifiers - literature: Voting Ensemble achieved highest R² (78.11%) [Thakur & Jadhav, 2025]
  - **Stacking:** Logistic regression meta-model on Isolation Forest + XGBoost + Autoencoder outputs
  - **Hybrid routing:** GRA prefilter reduces heavy model invocations by 40-70% [Sandström, 2024; Adlermann, 2024]
  - **Mixture-of-Experts:** Achieved 96.5% recall with <1.6% false positives [Islam et al., 2025]
  - Tested only if single model plateaus below KPI

- **Cost-Sensitive Optimization:**
  - **Cost ratio exploration:** 10:1, 50:1, 100:1 (FN:FP cost ratio)
  - Literature: CS-DNN with 50:1 ratio achieved recall 0.91 but precision dropped to 0.65 [Serdan, 2025]
  - **Optimal balance:** Determine cost ratio that achieves F1 ≥ 0.85

---

## 9. Deployment Strategy & Module Packaging
*Define how the finished model will be delivered as a module, without choosing the specific cloud provider.*

- **Interface Requirement:**
  - Python function: `predict(input: Dict) -> Dict`
  - Must strictly adhere to Section 0 contract
  - Async support for concurrent requests
  - Lightweight inference runtime (<500MB RAM) for mobile-first constraints [Hall, 2025]

- **Artifact Delivery:**
  - **Isolation Forest weights:** `.pkl` or `.joblib`
  - **Autoencoder weights:** `.h5` or `.pth` format
  - **XGBoost/LightGBM weights:** `.pkl` or `.joblib`
  - **Preprocessing pipeline:** `.pkl` or `.joblib`
  - **Scaler and feature transformer:** serialized as above
  - **Model version metadata:** training data hash, performance metrics, creation date
  - **Fallback model:** IQR statistical model for cold-start

- **Integration Point:**
  - **Containerized API service** (FastAPI preferred for async support) - literature: inference latency critical for user experience [Hall, 2025]
  - Called by mobile app via REST API
  - Dependency injection for model loading at startup
  - **Lightweight screening at edge** - GRA prefilter reduces heavy model invocations [Adlermann, 2024]

- **Deployment Candidates:**
  - **Docker container** (preferred for reproducibility)
  - **Serverless function** (if latency requirements can be met)
  - **Decision:** Docker on dedicated instance for consistent <300ms latency
  - **Mobile-first:** Consider exporting LightGBM model to ONNX or TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference [Hall, 2025]

---

## 10. Model Monitoring & Lifecycle Plan
*Define how we will know the module is degrading over time, without specifying the monitoring tool.*

- **Metrics to Track Post-Deployment:**
  - *Input Drift:* Monitor distribution changes in transaction amounts and categories - literature: use Population Stability Index (PSI) with threshold 10% [Paper 9, 2025]
  - *Output Drift:* Monitor anomaly flag rate (should remain stable around contamination rate)
  - *Performance:* Compare flagged anomalies to user feedback (whitelist additions)
  - *Precision/Recall:* Track user corrections (whitelist = false positive) and missed anomalies

- **Drift Detection Methods:**
  - **ADWIN** (Adaptive WINdowing) - literature: with incremental learning dominates on gradual drift [Paper 30, 2025]
  - **DDM** (Drift Detection Method) - literature: reacts fastest to abrupt shifts [Paper 30, 2025]
  - **EDDM** - literature: captures all critical drifts [Paper 69, 2025]
  - **CUSUM** - literature: for abrupt drift detection [Yashwanth et al., 2023]
  - **Hybrid detection:** EDDM + ADWIN combined - literature: achieved 100% drift detection rate [Paper 69, 2025]
  - **Dual detection:** CUSUM for abrupt + moving average for gradual - literature: detection delay 31.2 instances for abrupt, 64.8 for gradual [Yashwanth et al., 2023]
  - **KS Test:** Compares distributions - literature: identified 91.3% of significant changes within 18ms [Paper 97, 2025]
  - **Embedding cosine distance:** `Drift_rep = (1/k) Σ (1 - (h_t · h_{k-d})/(||h_t|| ||h_{k-d}||))` [Martin et al., 2023]

- **Retraining Triggers:**
  - Anomaly flag rate changes by >2x (significant drift)
  - User whitelist additions spike (high false positives) - literature: false positives reduced by 30-40% post-deployment with regularization [Paper 98, 2025]
  - Model performance drops below threshold (Precision < 0.80 or Recall < 0.60)
  - Rolling F1 < 0.75 for 3 consecutive weeks
  - Significant input drift detected (PSI > 0.1)
  - **Severity-aware retraining:** Quantile transformation reduces unnecessary retraining - literature: 93% of features exhibited significant drift [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025]

- **Adaptation Strategies:**
  - **Sliding-window retraining** - literature: improves accuracy by up to 5pp during volatile periods [Paper 29, 2025]
  - **Parameter updates** - literature: faster than structural updates [Xiang et al., 2023]
  - **Model reuse pool** - literature: Pool ICM reduced retraining events by up to 94% [Eliades & Papadopoulos, 2025]
  - **Adaptive buffering** - literature: retains only drifted batches for retraining; 0.80 accuracy vs FIFO (0.74) and No-Buffer (0.69) under recurring drift [Paper 53, 2025]
  - **Online adaptive RNN** - literature: effective for load forecasting under concept drift [Xiang et al., 2023]

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - User whitelist additions signal false positives → improve model
  - User marking transactions as normal (if anomaly reported) → feedback for model improvement
  - Monthly retraining with latest transaction data + user feedback
  - **Cost-Benefit Framework:** `S = α·Acc − β·Lat − γ·Cost − δ·FAR` - literature: no single configuration dominates across all regimes [Paper 29, 2025]

- **Evaluation Metrics for Drift:**
  - **OldTransfer** (knowledge preservation) - literature: GEM achieved 0.1785 OldTransfer [Pai et al., 2024]
  - **NewTransfer** (adaptation to new data) - literature: critical for measuring adaptation performance [Pai et al., 2024]
  - **Backward Transfer (BWT)** - measures forgetting [Martin et al., 2023]

## 11. Timeline, Dependencies, and Decision Gates
*Break down the 10 phases into a realistic schedule for the thesis project.*

| Phase | Deliverable | Estimated Duration | Success Gate (Go/No-Go) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 & 3 (Data) | Cleaned, versioned dataset | 14 days | Dataset passes quality checks; minimum 100,000 transactions; IQR outlier handling validated |
| 4 & 5 (EDA & Features) | Feature matrix ready; EDA report | 7 days | EDA confirms anomaly patterns; feature importance identified; temporal patterns validated |

| 8 (Optimization) | Final optimized model | 10 days | Final model meets KPI: F1 ≥ 0.85, Recall ≥ 0.85, FPR ≤ 0.05 [Huang A. et al., 2025; Al Rafi, 2024] |
| 9 & 10 (Deploy & Monitor) | Packaged module + monitoring setup | 10 days | Integration test passes; drift detection (ADWIN/EDDM) configured; monitoring metrics configured |

**Total Estimated Duration: 55 days (~2 months)**

---

## 12. Cold-Start Hypothesis
*Define how the module handles new users with limited or no historical data.*

- **Core Hypothesis:** New users can be detected for anomalies using behavioral biometrics, synthetic data generation, transfer learning, or unsupervised baselines until sufficient transaction history is accumulated.

- **Strategies from Literature:**

| Strategy | Mechanism | Evidence |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Self-Supervised Learning** | Pretext tasks on unlabeled data; learns from behavior patterns | SSL achieved F1=0.96; AUC 0.91 for credit risk vs XGBoost 0.84 [Al Rafi, 2024; Yachamaneni et al., 2025] |
| **Behavioral Biometrics** | Dynamic trust-weighted embeddings identify users after 14 seconds of interaction | Achieves 97.6% user identification accuracy using interaction patterns [Islam et al., 2025] |
| **Synthetic Data Generation** | GANs, SMOTE, ADASYN, or LLM-based augmentation for cold-start users | PAnDA achieved 15-37% performance gain on cold-start tasks [Du et al., 2025]; TVAE achieved 89% ROC AUC vs 52-59% for alternatives [Paper 76, 2025] |
| **Transfer Learning** | Knowledge Concept Graph (KCG) enables zero-shot profiling | TechCD achieved 56.73% ACC with out-domain data [Gao et al., 2023] |
| **Unsupervised Baselines** | Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, autoencoders require only normal data | TA-IFDC achieved F1=0.927 without labels [Huang A. et al., 2025] |
| **Federated Learning** | Collaborative training across institutions without sharing raw data | SCAFFOLD achieves 84.7% accuracy with robust non-IID performance [Paper 33, 2025] |
| **Active Learning** | Iterative labeling of uncertain cases for exploration | Mainstream approach for cold-start and label scarcity [Zhou & He, 2023] |

- **Combined Approach:**
  - **Immediate:** Unsupervised Isolation Forest + autoencoder using available data (even minimal)
  - **First 14 seconds:** Behavioral biometrics profile with trust-weighted embeddings [Islam et al., 2025]
  - **First 30 days:** Hybrid ensemble with synthetic data augmentation
  - **After 3 months:** Full ensemble model with personalized features
  - **Dynamic update:** User profile continuously updated as actual data arrives
  - **Fallback:** IQR rule-based detection + SHAP explanations for transparency

- **Expected Performance:**
  - **Day 0:** F1 ≥ 0.60 (unsupervised baseline)
  - **Day 14:** F1 ≥ 0.70 (behavioral biometrics + synthetic data)
  - **Day 30:** F1 ≥ 0.75 (hybrid ensemble + active learning)
  - **Day 90:** F1 ≥ 0.85 (full ensemble with personalized features)

---

## 13. Concept Drift & Assumptions
*Define how the module handles changing user behavior and economic conditions over time.*

- **Core Assumption:** Non-stationarity is the norm in financial data, not the exception [Cabral et al., 2026]. Static models degrade over time and require continuous adaptation. 91% of ML models experience performance decay in production, sometimes within days [Paper 97, 2025].

- **Types of Drift to Handle:**

| Type | Description | Detection Method | Evidence |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Abrupt** | Sudden distribution change (e.g., pandemic, job loss) | CUSUM, DDM, Page-Hinkley | Detection delay: 31.2 instances [Yashwanth et al., 2023]; ARF+HT achieves 0.94 AUC [Paper 48, 2025] |
| **Gradual** | Slow change over time (e.g., lifestyle changes) | Moving average, ADWIN | Detection delay: 64.8 instances [Yashwanth et al., 2023] |
| **Recurrent** | Past distributions reappear (e.g., seasonal patterns) | Pool ICM, exchangeability testing | Pool ICM reduced retraining events by up to 94% [Eliades & Papadopoulos, 2025] |
| **Incremental** | Slow, continuous shift | EWMA, sliding window | Most challenging; neither adaptation nor lifelong learning performs well [Pai et al., 2024] |

- **Detection Methods:**

| Method | Description | Performance |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **ADWIN** | Adaptive windowing for streaming data | Handles gradual drift effectively; with incremental learning dominates on gradual drift [Paper 30, 2025] |
| **DDM** | Drift Detection Method based on error rates | Reacts fastest to abrupt shifts [Paper 30, 2025] |
| **EDDM** | Early Drift Detection Method | Captures all critical drifts [Paper 69, 2025] |
| **Hybrid** | EDDM + ADWIN combined | 100% drift detection rate [Paper 69, 2025] |
| **KS Test** | Kolmogorov-Smirnov compares distributions | Identified 91.3% of significant changes within 18ms [Paper 97, 2025] |
| **Embedding cosine** | Distance between hidden representations | `Drift_rep = (1/k) Σ (1 - (h_t · h_{k-d})/(||h_t|| ||h_{k-d}||))` [Martin et al., 2023] |

- **Adaptation Strategies:**

| Strategy | Effectiveness | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Sliding-window retraining** | Improves AUC by up to 5pp during volatile periods | [Paper 29, 2025] |
| **Parameter updates** | Faster than structural updates; common approach | [Xiang et al., 2023] |
| **Model reuse pool** | Pool ICM reduced retraining events by 94% with <3% accuracy loss | [Eliades & Papadopoulos, 2025] |
| **Adaptive buffering** | 0.80 accuracy vs FIFO (0.74) and No-Buffer (0.69) under recurring drift | [Paper 53, 2025] |
| **Severity-aware** | Quantile transformation reduced KS statistic from 0.0559 to 0.0072 | [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025] |
| **Batch training** | Outperforms ignoring drift; robust performance across diverse streams | [Pereira & Da Silva, 2025] |
| **Online adaptive RNN** | Effective for load forecasting under concept drift | [Xiang et al., 2023] |

- **Key Assumptions Documented:**

| Assumption | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **Drift is inevitable** | "Non-stationarity is the norm in financial data, not the exception" [Cabral et al., 2026] |
| **Static models fail** | Traditional models degrade within 12-18 months; retraining alone insufficient [Chikoore et al., 2026] |
| **Drift patterns recur** | "Recurrent concept drift, where past data distributions reappear, is common" [Eliades & Papadopoulos, 2025] |
| **Data drift ≠ Model drift** | Data drift (covariate shift) can be addressed with quantile transformation; concept drift requires model retraining [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025] |
| **Statistical tests detect drift** | JS Divergence, KS tests, Wasserstein distance widely used, but pooled analysis can mask subgroup-level drift [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025] |
| **Seasonal patterns stable** | Multi-SARIMA assumes two seasonal periods exist; performance degrades if patterns drift [Williams et al., 2023] |
| **Subgroup-level drift** | Subgroup-level analysis can reveal drift masked by pooled aggregation; 44 of 45 areas showed significant drift despite overall no drift [Shakhovska & Pukach, 2025] |

- **Critical Design Principles:**
  1. **Assume concept drift is inevitable** → Build adaptive mechanisms [Cabral et al., 2026]
  2. **Prioritize recall over accuracy** → Cost of missed fraud > false alarms [Karthikeyan et al., 2026]
  3. **Use behavioral indicators** → Transaction frequency, device/location consistency [Shaha & Gavekar, 2025]
  4. **Implement adaptive thresholds** → Dynamic adjustment based on performance feedback [Huang A. et al., 2025]
  5. **Address cold-start early** → Synthetic data via TVAE or LLM augmentation [Paper 76, 2025; Du et al., 2025]
  6. **Monitor for concept drift continuously** → Dual ADWIN+EDDM strategy [Paper 69, 2025]
  7. **Design for 30-day data windows** - longer windows don't improve performance [Heirene et al., 2026]

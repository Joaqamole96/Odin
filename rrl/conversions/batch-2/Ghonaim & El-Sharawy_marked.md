Recurrent neural network The results demonstrated that the model was highly accurate in the classification of finan-
cial transactions based on the level of risk. The application was tested on new data; it
reached an overall accuracy of 97.45%. Precision, recall, and F1 measures are all higher
than 0.97 for each of the risk categories: low, medium, and high. These results validate the
reliability of the system, particularly in detecting critical low- and high-risk behaviors, and
its capacity to help users make safer and more informed decisions regarding their finances.

vices, including recording expenditures across categories
such as necessities, loans, and discretionary spending
within a monthly adjustable budget. The application tracks
both daily and monthly expenditures across all categories
and generates detailed reports that help users monitor their
financial status and spending patterns. One of the most im-

to analyze spending data and even foresee the potential cri-

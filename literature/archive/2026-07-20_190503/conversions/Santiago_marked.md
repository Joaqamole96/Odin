Abstract: Public elementary schools in the Philippines face persistent challenges in managing their financial resources, primarily due to reliance
on manual processes that are prone to errors, inefficiencies, and a lack of transparency. To address these concerns, this study developed a Budget
and Financial Management Information System (BFMIS) tailored to the operational needs of public elementary schools. The system integrates
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and linear regression analytics to automate budget planning, optimize the allocation of Maintenance and Other
Operating Expenses (MOOE), and enhance financial reporting. Using Agile methodology, the system was designed with a user-centered
approach and developed through iterative cycles involving continuous stakeholder feedback. Core features include modules for budget
allocation, expenditure tracking, predictive budgeting, and automated report generation in compliance with the Department of Education
(DepEd) financial policies. The system underwent black-box testing and was evaluated against ISO/IEC 25010 (software quality) and ISO 27001
(information security) standards. Furthermore, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) was conducted using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
to assess perceived usefulness, ease of use, and user satisfaction among school administrators, financial officers, and DepEd auditors. Results
showed that BFMIS significantly improved accuracy in budget forecasting, enhanced accountability through audit trails and real-time
dashboards, and facilitated informed financial decision-making. The integration of predictive analytics reduced human error and supported
proactive planning and equitable resource utilization. This research contributes a scalable, AI-driven solution for improving financial
management processes in the Philippine public education sector.

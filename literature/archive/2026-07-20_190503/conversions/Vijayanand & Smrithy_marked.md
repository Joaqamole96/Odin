Abstract
This research paper addresses the pressing problem of financial fraud in the changing context of digital banking by inte-
grating machine learning and explainable AI, specifically exploiting SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). With a focus
on enhancing both accuracy and interpretability, this study utilizes a synthetically generated dataset from the PaySim
simulator, encompassing 6,362,620 records. The usefulness of an Ensemble Learning Model with a Voting Classifier is
shown by its evaluation of different machine learning models, which achieves an excellent accuracy of 99.904%.Empha-

stakeholders to understand the logic underlying the models forecasts. Not only does a lack of transparency undermine
trust, but it also creates regulatory problems in sectors where explainability is essential. According to data scientists,
machine learning models can not be understood or trusted unless they are interpretable.7 Combining machine learning

Explainable AI becomes crucial for demystifying machine learning models’ decision-making processes, especially
with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Explainable AI is essential for fostering trust in financial institutions and

2 Literature survey
The need for robust systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activities has become paramount, leading to a shift from
traditional approaches to more adaptive and intelligent solutions. Ali et al.8 reviewed ML applications in detecting
financial fraud, emphasizing the limitations of traditional methods and highlighting SVM and ANN as key algorithms.
It addresses issues and gaps, suggesting exploration of ensemble methods and unsupervised learning like clustering.

Awosika T. et al.22 introduced a novel approach to address fraudulent transactions in the financial sector, combining
Explainable AI (XAI) and Federated Learning (FL) to enhance transparency and interpretability in fraud detection sys-
tems. The integration of SHAP ensures accurate and understandable predictions, shedding light on influential features
and justifying decisions. This emphasis on transparency becomes crucial in sensitive domains, emphasizing that XAI is
essentialforaccountability,usertrust,andregulatorycomplianceinFL-basedfrauddetectionsystems.Table1showsthe

“type,”“amount,”“nameOrig,”“oldbalanceOrg,”“newbalanceOrig,”“nameDest,”“oldbalanceDest,”“newbalanceDest,”
“isFraud,” and “isFlaggedFraud.” Then we go on to the current features. Unwanted features such as “step,” “type,”

Additionally, we conduct checks for missing values in the target variable, “isFraud,” and address them by dropping
rows with missing values. After cleaning the data, it is divided into two sets: one for testing and one for training. The
stratification is kept and the test size is set at 20%. The final dimensions of the split datasets are verified to confirm the

known machine learning models: Neural Network, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

When solving tasks like classification, ensemble learning uses a combination of many learning models that have been
deliberatelygenerated.52 Thisisbasedonthenotionthattwomindsarepreferabletoone.Additionally,wegatherinfor-
mation from various sources and rank or combine them in order to make strategic judgments. A supervised learning
algorithm is an ensemble in and of itself. Many classifier systems are another name for ensemble learning systems.32
Usingthesamedatatotrainseveralmodelsandthencombiningtheirpredictionsisknownasensemblelearning.53
The
goal of ensemble learning is to improve performance above that of a single model by combining many models into a
singleensemble.53 Thefirststepistodeterminehowtobuildtheensemblemodels,andthesecondistofigureouthowto

learning.54
This instance makes use of a meta classifier, which is able to merge prediction models from different or comparable
machine learning datasets by means of a majority vote or soft voting. To choose the most likely class, soft voting aver-
ages the base models’ class pseudo-probabilities.55 The voting classifier outperforms the other baseline models because
to its ability to incorporate the predictions of many ML and DL models.56 Figure 5 illustrates our proposed ensemble
model, a culmination of various classifiers aimed at elevating predictive performance through strategic combination. A
number of classifiers—including XGBoost, LightBGM, Neural Networks, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest
Classifier—arepartofthisensemble.Table8showstheStratifiedK-Foldcrossvalidationresultsoftheensemblelearning

Coined by DARPA in 2016, Explainable AI (XAI) addresses the need for transparency in AI systems, countering the
‘blackbox’natureofmachinelearning.Crucialindelicatefieldslikehealthcareandbanking,XAIseekstoensurethatAI

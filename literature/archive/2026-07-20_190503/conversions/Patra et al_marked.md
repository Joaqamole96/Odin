proposed to model financial factors, including income, expenditure, savings, risk,
and market dynamics, into a single framework to reflect both human and
environmental factors. Time-series forecasting models are used for financial
predictions, and reinforcement learning for investment strategy optimization.
Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess various financial scenarios and assess
the feasibility of achieving specific financial objectives. The tool offers tailored
financial plans, feasibility measures, and recommendations to help make more
realistic and informed decisions. Empirical experiments show that the proposed
system increases the accuracy of forecasts, adaptability, and more accurate goal
feasibility evaluations than traditional rule-based approaches. The results indicate
that embedding contextual awareness and adaptive learning capabilities in
financial planning systems greatly enhances their performance. The study presents
a scalable and smart approach that integrates predictive analytics with goal-based
financial planning, which can be applied in fintech applications and personal
financial advisors.

ABSTRACT Despite significant advances in Machine Learning (ML) for Credit Scoring, the persistence
of drift effects manifested as performance degradation due to evolving borrower behaviour, economic
conditions,andshiftingdatadistributionsremainsacriticalchallenge.Associoeconomicconditionschange,
previously learned relationships between input features and target variables become unstable, leading to
concept drift, population drift, and label drift. These dynamics reduce model accuracy and reliability,
increasemisclassificationrates,andexposefinancialinstitutionstosubstantialfinancialandregulatoryrisks.

adaptive approaches are largely developed for advanced economies and are not well-suited to developing
contexts.Thisstudyproposesanadaptivecreditscoringframework,termedAdaptiveFusion,designedto
address drift in developing economy environments. The framework integrates baseline ML models with
dynamic adaptation strategies, including retraining, windowing, ensemble learning, and adaptive fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that the Retrained Random Forest, Ensemble, and Adaptive Fusion
models achieve superior and consistent performance, each attaining an accuracy of 95.0%, a precision
of 0.9275, a recall of 0.9645, an F1-score of 0.9426, and ROC-AUC values exceeding 0.96. Compared
to state-of-the-art models such as the Deep Genetic Hierarchical Network of Learners (DGHNL), which
achieves94.60%accuracyandanAUCof0.9360,theproposedapproachdemonstratesimprovedpredictive
capability, highlighting the effectiveness of dynamic model integration. The Adaptive Fusion algorithm,
whichdynamicallyweightsandintegratesmodeloutputsinrealtime,emergesasthemostrobustsolution,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving data patterns. These findings underscore the importance of

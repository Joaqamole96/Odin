Artificial Intelligence-Driven Transformation in Financial
Technology: Applications, Agents and Challenges
Zhizhou Zhang1,2,* and Meiqi Lu3,*
Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a pivotal force in the financial technology (fintech) sector, reshaping services through
enhanced automation, improved efficiency, and personalization. The integration of sophisticated AI models, however,
introduces significant challenges concerning data privacy, algorithmic bias, and a lack of transparency, which necessitates a
systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the field. This review provides a holistic synthesis of the current landscape,
introducing a structured taxonomy of AI applications that ranges from foundational machine learning in areas like credit
scoring and fraud detection to advanced autonomous agents capable of dynamic decision making. It systematically analyzes
critical technical and ethical hurdles, including model interpretability, data quality issues, and security vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, the review examines emerging paradigms, such as the deployment of autonomous and multi-agent systems
that are revolutionizing financial workflows and strategies. By bridging the gap between AI and financial applications and
identifying unresolved challenges, this analysis delineates a clear agenda for future research aimed at fostering a more robust,
transparent, and equitable AI-driven financial ecosystem.
